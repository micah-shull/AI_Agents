        "\n",
        "* **Monitors** all AI-generated outputs (e.g., marketing copy, contracts, recommendations).\n",
        "* **Evaluates** them against company and regulatory rulesets (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).\n",
        "* **Flags** potential compliance issues and **escalates** to human reviewers.\n",
        "* **Logs** all activity for **auditability** and **legal defense**.\n",

        "* **Differentiation:** Most current agents *do* tasks; yours *audits* them.\n",
        "* **Incremental Build:** Start simple (text auditing), expand later (marketing, contract, data).\n",
