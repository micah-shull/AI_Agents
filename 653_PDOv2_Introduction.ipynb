        "Version 2 of the Proposal & Document Orchestrator expands the system from a governed document workflow engine into a **portfolio-level decision and risk management platform for knowledge work**.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Version 1 focused on controlling the lifecycle of individual documents—drafting, review, compliance, cost tracking, and outcomes—Version 2 introduces **cross-document intelligence**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* portfolio-wide bottleneck detection\n",
        "* reviewer economics and escalation authority\n",
        "* risk-tiered workflows\n",

        "The result is not simply better documents.\n",

        "## Why Version 2 Exists\n",
        "\n",
        "In most enterprises, documents such as proposals, regulatory filings, policies, and client reports are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* slow to produce\n",
        "* expensive to revise\n",
        "* reviewed inconsistently\n",

        "* where money is being spent\n",
        "* which reviews are driving delays\n",
        "* which risks are systemic\n",
        "* which approvals actually prevent failures\n",
        "* how governance decisions affect revenue timing\n",
