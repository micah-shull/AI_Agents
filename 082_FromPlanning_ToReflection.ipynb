        "  * `1` = every loop (max insight, more tokens/latency)\n",
        "  * `2+` = periodic check-ins (balanced cost)\n",

        "\n",

        "* **Context size:** Reports add tokens to memory. Consider **summarizing or pruning** old reports over time.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Practical tips\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Structure the output**: have `track_progress` return JSON (`progress`, `blockers`, `next_steps`, `suggested_tools`). Easier to parse in the next loop.\n",
        "* **Throttle on success**: if `blockers` is empty for a few iterations, temporarily **increase `track_frequency`** to save cost.\n",
        "* **Tag memories**: prefix content (e.g., `\"[Progress]\"`) so you can filter them quickly for prompts or dashboards.\n",
