        "  * `1` = every loop (max insight, more tokens/latency)\n",
        "  * `2+` = periodic check-ins (balanced cost)\n",
        "* `memory_type`: where the report lands (e.g., `\"system\"` to increase its weight in the next prompt, or `\"assistant\"` if you want it treated as normal assistant output).\n",
        "* Internal counter (`iteration_count`): ensures **deterministic cadence** for reflection (e.g., “every 3rd loop”).\n",

        "## Why it runs at the *end* of the loop\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Cost/latency:** Each reflection is an extra LLM call. Use `track_frequency` to tune.\n",
        "* **Context size:** Reports add tokens to memory. Consider **summarizing or pruning** old reports over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Practical tips\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Structure the output**: have `track_progress` return JSON (`progress`, `blockers`, `next_steps`, `suggested_tools`). Easier to parse in the next loop.\n",
        "* **Throttle on success**: if `blockers` is empty for a few iterations, temporarily **increase `track_frequency`** to save cost.\n",
