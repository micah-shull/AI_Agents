        "The business logic orchestrator identifies **three types of opportunities**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Routine Gaps** - Missing essential skincare steps (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer, SPF)\n",
        "2. **Cross-Sell Opportunities** - Complementary products based on what customer owns\n",
        "3. **Upsell Opportunities** - Replenishment needs and bundle opportunities\n",
        "\n",
        "Then it **scores and ranks** all opportunities to prioritize the highest-value recommendations.\n",

        "### What It Does\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "identify_routine_gaps(customer_categories, essential_categories)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Customer has: `[\"cleanser\", \"moisturizer\"]`\n",
        "- Essential categories: `[\"cleanser\", \"toner\", \"serum\", \"moisturizer\", \"spf\"]`\n",
        "- Returns: `[\"toner\", \"serum\", \"spf\"]` (missing categories)\n",

        "- Easy to understand and debug\n",

        "\n",
        "**Alternative Approaches We Could Have Used:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM-Based Gap Detection**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Alternative: Use LLM to analyze customer routine\n",
        "   prompt = f\"Customer has {customer_categories}. What's missing?\"\n",
        "   gaps = llm_call(prompt)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - ❌ **Why not:** Expensive, slow, non-deterministic\n",
        "   - ✅ **When to use:** If routine logic is complex or changes frequently\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rule-Based with Priorities**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Alternative: Weighted importance\n",
        "   essential = {\"cleanser\": 1.0, \"toner\": 0.8, \"serum\": 0.9, ...}\n",

        "   - ✅ **When to use:** If you need to prioritize which gaps to fill first\n",

        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "check_replenishment_needs(customer_products, product_catalog)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logic:**\n",
        "1. For each product customer owns, get purchase date\n",
        "2. Calculate days since purchase\n",
        "3. Compare to product's `replenishment_cycle_days`\n",

        "   days_until_empty = predicted_usage / daily_usage_rate\n",

        "\n",
        "**Decision:** Time-based with product-specific cycles because:\n",

        "### Easy Changes (No Architecture Changes)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Adjust Scoring Weights**\n",
        "   - Change 40/30/20/10 to different ratios\n",
        "   - Test impact on recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Add More Replenishment Urgency Levels**\n",
        "   - Currently: due, approaching\n",
        "   - Could add: critical (60+ days), warning (14-7 days)\n",
