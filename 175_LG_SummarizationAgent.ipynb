        "Excellent! Great to hear the red squiggles are gone. Let me explain what these steps do - this is really useful knowledge for working with Cursor/VS Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "## **What These Steps Do**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Restart Python Language Server**\n",
        "**What it is**: The Python Language Server is a background process that analyzes your Python code to provide:\n",
        "- Syntax highlighting\n",
        "- Error detection (red squiggles)\n",
        "- Auto-completion\n",
        "- Import resolution\n",
        "- Type checking\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why restart it**: When you install new packages, the language server might still be using its old \"memory\" of what packages are available. Restarting forces it to re-scan your environment and discover the newly installed packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use**: After installing new packages, changing Python interpreters, or when you see false import errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Python Interpreter Selection**\n",
        "**What it is**: This tells Cursor which Python executable to use for:\n",
        "- Running your code\n",
        "- Analyzing imports\n",
        "- Providing autocomplete\n",
        "- Error checking\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it matters**: You have multiple Python installations on your system:\n",
        "- System Python (`/usr/bin/python3`)\n",
        "- Your virtual environment Python (`.venv/bin/python`)\n",
        "- Maybe others\n",
        "\n",
        "**The problem**: If Cursor is using the wrong Python, it won't see the packages you installed in your virtual environment, causing those red squiggles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The fix**: Selecting `.venv/bin/python` tells Cursor \"use the Python from my virtual environment, which has all my packages.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Reload Window**\n",
        "**What it is**: Completely refreshes the entire Cursor interface, like restarting the app but faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it works**: Sometimes the language server and other components get out of sync. A reload forces everything to restart fresh.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use**: When other fixes don't work, or when you've made major changes to your environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **The Root Cause**\n",
        "\n",
        "The issue was that when you ran `./scripts/bootstrap.sh`, it installed packages into your virtual environment, but Cursor's language server was still \"remembering\" the old state where those packages didn't exist. It's like updating your phone's app list but the phone still showing the old list until you refresh it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Pro Tips for Cursor**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Always check the bottom-right corner** - it shows which Python interpreter you're using\n",
        "- **Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)** is your best friend - it's like Spotlight for Cursor\n",
        "- **Virtual environments are isolated** - packages installed in one venv aren't visible to others\n",
        "- **Language Server restarts** are usually the first thing to try when imports look wrong\n",

        "## Executive Summary\n",
        "In the age of generative AI, success for organizations hinges on leadership and organizational transformation rather than solely on technological advancements. Leaders must cultivate five critical skills: spanning organizational boundaries, redesigning organizations, fostering human-AI collaboration, managing change effectively, and capturing value from AI initiatives. A recent analysis revealed that while many companies tout AI's potential, few can articulate tangible benefits, often due to a lack of alignment between technology and organizational processes. To thrive, executives must focus on integrating AI into their value propositions and adapting their organizational structures accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Strategic Implementation\n",
        "To implement these concepts effectively, organizations should:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Foster Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Encourage leaders to engage in diverse networks that include technologists, startups, and regulatory bodies. This exposure will help them gain insights into AI's practical applications and foster innovation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Redesign Workflows**: Move beyond merely integrating AI into existing processes. Organizations should evaluate and redesign workflows to leverage AI capabilities fully. This may involve rethinking roles, incentives, and structures to align with AI's strengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Establish Change Management Frameworks**: Develop a structured approach to manage the organizational changes that accompany AI implementation. This includes training programs, communication strategies, and feedback loops to ensure employee buy-in and adaptation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Create a Culture of Experimentation**: Encourage a mindset that embraces trial and error, allowing teams to explore AI applications without fear of failure. This can lead to innovative uses of AI that align with organizational goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Manager Guidance\n",
        "For executives leading AI initiatives, consider the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lead by Example**: Demonstrate a commitment to AI by actively participating in learning and discussions about its implications. Share insights from your experiences to inspire your teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Invest in Training**: Provide resources for continuous learning about AI and its applications. This will empower employees to embrace AI tools and foster a culture of innovation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encourage Interdisciplinary Teams**: Form teams that bring together diverse skill sets and perspectives. This diversity can enhance problem-solving and innovation in AI applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Monitor and Measure Impact**: Establish metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of AI initiatives. Regularly assess both the technological and organizational outcomes to ensure alignment with strategic goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Personal Development\n",
        "As a data scientist, focus on developing the following skills:\n",
