        "### Scenario Set 1: Policy Violations ✅\n",
        "- EU decision without human approval (high severity)\n",
        "- Financial recommendation with low confidence (medium severity)\n",
        "- HR decision referencing protected attributes (high severity)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scenario Set 2: Bias Signals ✅\n",

        "- Keep it simple: flag if delta > 20% (statistically suspicious)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scenario Set 3: Drift & Degradation ✅\n",

        "   - Include all three scenario types\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Build MVP Structure**\n",

        "   - Design state schema\n",
        "   - Build foundation nodes\n",
        "   - Build utilities (policy matching, risk scoring)\n",

        "3. **Test Incrementally**\n",
        "   - Test data loading first\n",
        "   - Test policy matching\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Policies:** Start with 3-5 simple rules (not full EU AI Act)\n",
        "2. **Bias Detection:** Simple statistical deltas (not complex fairness math)\n",
        "3. **Drift Detection:** Simple threshold comparisons (not ML-based)\n",
        "4. **No Real Regulations:** Use synthetic but realistic policy names\n",
        "\n",
        "**This is perfect for learning.** You can add complexity later.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✅ Ready to Build?\n",
        "\n",
        "Your data proposal is **ready to commit**. The structure is:\n",
        "- ✅ Focused on MVP essentials\n",
        "- ✅ Realistic enough to learn from\n",
        "- ✅ Simple enough to build quickly\n",
