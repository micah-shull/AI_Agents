        "## 🎯 **Strategy for Fine-Tuning!**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's exactly what I'd recommend asking ChatGPT for:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **📋 Request for ChatGPT:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**\"Our Compliance Sentinel Agent is working with 71.4% accuracy on the first 7 test cases. Now I need additional test cases to fine-tune and improve the agent. Please create:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. ADDITIONAL MARKETING TEST CASES (5-7 more):**\n",
        "- Focus on **edge cases** and **borderline scenarios**\n",
        "- Include more **WARNING** cases (our agent tends to classify these as PASS or VIOLATION)\n",
        "- Add **complex scenarios** with multiple compliance issues\n",
        "- Include **real-world examples** that are harder to classify\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT AREAS:**\n",
        "- **Unsubstantiated Claims**: Cases where claims need supporting data but aren't outright false\n",
        "- **Influencer Disclosure**: Social media posts missing #ad/#sponsored tags\n",
        "- **Ambiguous Language**: Marketing copy that's technically true but potentially misleading\n",
        "- **Missing Disclaimers**: Content that needs risk warnings but isn't completely non-compliant\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. CHALLENGING SCENARIOS:**\n",
        "- **Multi-domain violations**: Content that violates multiple policies simultaneously\n",
        "- **Subtle violations**: Hard-to-detect compliance issues\n",
        "- **Context-dependent cases**: Content that's compliant in some contexts but not others\n",
        "\n",
        "**Format each test case the same way as before with:**\n",
        "- Clear test ID (MKT-008, MKT-009, etc.)\n",
        "- Content section\n",
        "- Expected verdict (PASS/WARNING/VIOLATION)\n",
        "- Policy references\n",
        "- Detailed rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "**The goal is to help our agent better distinguish between WARNING and other verdicts, and handle more complex compliance scenarios.**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **🔧 Fine-Tuning Strategy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we get the new test cases, we can:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for common misclassification patterns\n",
        "2. **Improve Prompts**: Refine the LLM evaluation prompts based on edge cases\n",
        "3. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune the decision logic for better WARNING detection\n",
        "4. **Expand Policy Retrieval**: Improve RAG to catch more nuanced compliance issues\n",
        "5. **Test Iteratively**: Run tests, analyze results, make improvements, repeat\n",
        "\n",
        "### **📊 Expected Outcomes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Higher Accuracy**: Target 80%+ accuracy on expanded test suite\n",
        "- **Better Warning Detection**: Improved distinction between PASS/WARNING/VIOLATION\n",

        "ChatGPT is ready to expand our Compliance Sentinel Agent to **Contract Compliance** - this is exactly the right next step! Let me give you my recommendations for the style preferences:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 **Style Recommendations for ChatGPT:**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Tone & Format:**\n",
        "**Recommendation: Plain-language compliance tone**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:**\n",
        "- ✅ **Easier for LLM to understand** and apply consistently\n",
        "- ✅ **More practical for AI agents** - matches how compliance teams actually work\n",
        "- ✅ **Better for RAG retrieval** - semantic search works better with clear language\n",
        "- ✅ **Consistent with our Marketing Policy** - maintains the same approachable style\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Test Set Scope:**\n",
        "**Recommendation: Mix of both - primarily clause-level examples with 1-2 longer excerpts**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:**\n",
        "- ✅ **Clause-level examples** (2-3 paragraphs) are perfect for MVP testing\n",
        "- ✅ **Faster to process** and easier to debug\n",
        "- ✅ **Real-world relevant** - most contract issues are clause-specific\n",
        "- ✅ **Include 1-2 longer excerpts** (1-2 pages) to test complex reasoning\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📋 **Specific Request for ChatGPT:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**\"Perfect! Please create both documents with these specifications:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**TONE & FORMAT:**\n",
        "- Use **plain-language compliance tone** (not formal legal language)\n",
        "- Keep it practical and actionable, similar to our Marketing Compliance Policy\n",
        "- Write as if for compliance teams, not lawyers\n",
        "\n",
        "**TEST SET SCOPE:**\n",
        "- **5-6 clause-level examples** (2-3 paragraphs each)\n",
        "- **1-2 longer contract excerpts** (1-2 pages each) for complex scenarios\n",
        "- Focus on **realistic AI-generated contract content** that FinOptima AI might produce\n",
        "\n",
        "**SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS:**\n",
        "- **Liability clauses** that are too broad or missing limitations\n",
        "- **Data sharing provisions** that violate GDPR/privacy\n",
        "- **Termination clauses** that are unfair or unclear\n",
        "- **Indemnification** that's overly aggressive\n",
        "- **Confidentiality** that's too restrictive or too loose\n",
        "- **Service level agreements** that make unrealistic promises\n",
        "\n",
        "**Please generate Contract Compliance Policy v1.0.md first, then Contract Test Set v1.0.md**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 **Why This Approach is Perfect:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Builds on Success**: We know our architecture works (71.4% accuracy)\n",
        "2. **Expands Domain**: Contract compliance is a huge enterprise need\n",
        "3. **Tests Complexity**: Contracts are more complex than marketing content\n",
        "4. **Real-World Value**: Contract compliance failures can be catastrophic\n",
        "5. **Iterative Improvement**: Each new domain makes our agent more robust\n",
        "\n",
        "**This will give us a comprehensive Compliance Sentinel Agent that can handle both marketing AND contract compliance - a powerful enterprise solution!**\n",

        "\n",
        "### **🎯 Next Steps for Improvement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Fine-tune Contract Prompts**: Adjust LLM prompts for contract-specific nuances\n",
