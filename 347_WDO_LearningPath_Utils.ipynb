        "This module is responsible for turning **prioritized skill gaps** into **personalized learning recommendations**. It answers a critical question for both employees and leadership:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **“Given the risks we see, what should this person actually learn next — and why?”**\n",
        "\n",
        "The design is intentionally conservative, transparent, and policy-driven. Learning paths are recommended only when there is a clear, defensible match.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Prerequisites Are Treated as Guardrails, Not Suggestions\n",
        "\n",
        "The `check_prerequisites_met` utility ensures that learning recommendations are **realistic and achievable**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key design choices:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Explicit handling of generic prerequisites (e.g., basic skills)\n",
        "* Strict checking for role- or skill-specific prerequisites\n",
        "* No silent assumptions about readiness\n",
        "\n",

        "The `calculate_learning_path_match_score` function assigns a **numeric confidence score** to each potential recommendation.\n",
        "\n",

        "* Exact alignment between the learning path’s target skill and the detected gap\n",
        "* Whether prerequisites are met\n",
        "* The urgency of the gap (derived earlier from automation risk and role needs)\n",

        "## 3. Thresholds Control Recommendation Behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "A recommendation is only produced if the match score exceeds a **configurable threshold**.\n",

        "The `match_employee_to_learning_paths` function assembles recommendations that are **employee-centered**:\n",
        "\n",

        "* Who it’s for\n",
        "* What skill it targets\n",
        "* Why it’s relevant\n",

        "## 5. Organization-Wide Matching Is Fair and Consistent\n",
        "\n",
        "The `match_all_employees_to_learning_paths` utility scales the same logic across the entire workforce.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Gaps are grouped by employee\n",
        "* Each employee is evaluated independently\n",
        "* The same policies and thresholds apply everywhere\n",

        "## 6. Learning Is Positioned as Enablement, Not Remediation\n",
        "\n",
        "One subtle but important design choice is how recommendations are framed:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Learning investments align directly to risk and role needs\n",
        "* Recommendations are justifiable and measurable\n",
        "* Noise is controlled through explicit thresholds\n",
        "* Progress can be tracked meaningfully\n",
