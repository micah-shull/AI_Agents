        "3. **Routing**: Classifying an input and directing it to a specialized follow-up task. This allows for handling diverse inputs by routing them to appropriate processes.([Anthropic][1])\n",

        "#### **3. Performance and latency trade-offs**\n",
        "\n",

        "#### **4. Subagent specialization**\n",
        "\n",
