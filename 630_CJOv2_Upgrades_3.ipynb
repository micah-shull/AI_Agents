        "### 1. **Predicted churn paths**\n",
        "- **Section:** “Predicted churn paths” after “Revenue at risk by journey stage.”\n",
        "- **Logic:** `_predicted_paths_summary(trajectory_risk)` groups by `predicted_path` (e.g. `support → churn_risk`), sums customers and revenue at risk, sorts by revenue at risk, takes top 6.\n",
        "- **Output:** Table: Predicted path | Customers | Revenue at risk.\n",

        "### 2. **Revenue at risk by journey stage**\n",
        "- **Section:** “Revenue at risk by journey stage” after “Segment view.”\n",
        "- **Logic:** `_revenue_by_stage(trajectory_risk)` groups by `current_stage`, counts customers and sums `revenue_at_risk`.\n",

        "### 3. **KPI summary (operational / effectiveness)**\n",
        "- **Section:** “KPI summary (operational / effectiveness)” after the ROI leaderboard.\n",
        "- **Metrics:**\n",
        "  - **Playbook success rate (portfolio):** Weighted average of `success_rate` by `runs` from `playbook_performance_log`; **on_track** if ≥ `kpi_success_rate_min` (default 0.6).\n",
        "  - **Human override rate:** Share of `outcomes` with `human_override` true; **on_track** if ≤ `kpi_override_rate_max` (default 0.2).\n",
        "  - **Avg resolution time (days):** Mean of `resolution_time_days` in `outcomes`; **on_track** if ≤ `kpi_resolution_time_days_target` (default 5).\n",

        "### 4. **Playbook health / review flags**\n",
        "- **Placement:** Under “Intervention ROI leaderboard,” after the leaderboard table.\n",
        "- **Logic:** Playbooks with `success_rate` < `playbook_review_success_rate_min` (0.5) or `roi_ratio` < `playbook_review_roi_ratio_min` (15) are listed as “Playbooks under review” with reasons.\n",

        "### 5. **ROI significance (top playbooks)**\n",
        "- **Section:** “ROI significance (top playbooks)” after KPI summary.\n",
        "- **Logic:** Top 3 playbooks by ROI with `runs` ≥ 5; for each, call `toolshed.statistics.test_roi_significance(roi_estimate=avg_value*runs, cost=avg_cost*runs)`. If `is_significantly_positive`: “ROI statistically significantly positive.” Otherwise: “High ROI (Xx); significance testing requires historical ROI series.” If import or run fails, show a short fallback message. If no playbooks have runs ≥ 5, show “Insufficient run count…”.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Stronger next steps**\n",
        "- **Placement:** In “Business impact,” replacing the single “Next step” line.\n",
        "- **Logic:** If there are recommended interventions: (1) If any require approval, list their customer IDs (up to 5) and “Require status within 5 business days.” (2) If any don’t require approval, “Execute N intervention(s)… target resolution within 5 days.” (3) “Monitor outcomes and playbook performance….” If there are no recommendations: “Monitor portfolio; run again when new signals or forecasts are available.”\n",
