        "This final set of utilities, the **Synthesis Agent (Step 6)**, is the ultimate goal of your entire orchestrator. Its role is to take the disparate analytical outputs from all previous agents—the clusters, the rules, the motifs, and the scores—and **synthesize** them into a unified list of **actionable, ranked business opportunities.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where the raw data is finally transformed into the final, consumable **strategy**.\n",

        "The module's power comes from its ability to validate findings across multiple analytical methods and score them based on business value.\n",

        "### 1. The Synthesis Engine (`combine_insights`)\n",
        "\n",

Only robust, multi-perspective findings are confirmed. |\n",
        "| **`score_opportunities`** | Calculates the **Composite Score**. This score is a weighted blend of: **Confidence** ($\\text{40\\%}$), **Business Value** ($\\text{30\\%}$), **Feasibility** ($\\text{20\\%}$), and **Evidence Strength** ($\\text{10\\%}$). | **Prioritizes Action:** Embeds the business's priorities (confidence is key) into the final metric, ensuring the agent recommends high-quality, executable ideas. |\n",
