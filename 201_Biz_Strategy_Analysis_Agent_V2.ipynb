        "\n",
        "**Decision:** Build a modular component library where nodes are reusable, testable units.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rationale:**\n",
        "- Enables code reuse across multiple agents\n",
        "- Makes testing easier (test components independently)\n",
        "- Allows experimentation (mix and match components)\n",
        "- Follows industry best practices (LangChain, Anthropic patterns)\n",

        "**Rationale:**\n",
        "- Frameworks have different needs (research, analysis, benchmarking)\n",
        "- Specialized agents can be optimized for their frameworks\n",
        "- Clearer separation of concerns\n",
