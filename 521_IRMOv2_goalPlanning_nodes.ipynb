        "\n",
        "Instead of letting objectives emerge implicitly from code paths or tool calls, the agent starts by explicitly stating:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **What it is evaluating**\n",

        "* **Whether it is analyzing the entire ecosystem or a single agent**\n",

        "* **Intentional** — it knows why it exists\n",
        "* **Predictable** — execution follows a defined plan\n",
        "* **Auditable** — goals and steps are visible\n",
