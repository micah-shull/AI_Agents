        "\n",

        "3. **Side effects vs pure transforms**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Prefer **pure functions** in `process_*` hooks (change the value, not global state).\n",
        "   * Use `init` and `end_agent_loop` for side effects (e.g., logging, metrics, progress notes) so you don’t surprise other capabilities.\n",

        "   * If the loop retries, your capability methods shouldn’t duplicate content (e.g., don’t prepend “Current time:” twice). Add guards or markers.\n",

        "5. **Performance**\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Error handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Consider wrapping each reducer segment with try/except so one misbehaving capability doesn’t crash the agent.\n",
