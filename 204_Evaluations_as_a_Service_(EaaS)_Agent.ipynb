        "## 💡 What Makes This Agent Different & Valuable\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Orchestration Pattern: Multi-Agent Coordination** ⭐ CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "**What you learned:**\n",
        "- Your agent doesn't solve a problem directly - it **coordinates other agents**\n",
        "- It manages state across multiple agents, scenarios, and results\n",
        "- It creates a **unified view** of performance across an entire agent ecosystem\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "Standard approach:\n",
        "- Agent A evaluated separately → Report A\n",
        "- Agent B evaluated separately → Report B\n",
        "- No cross-agent insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Orchestrator approach:\n",
        "- Agent A + Agent B evaluated together → Unified report\n",
        "- Discover: \"Agents fail on similar scenarios\" → Strategic insight\n",
        "- Discover: \"Agent A is 3x faster but less accurate\" → Trade-off analysis\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**The network effect:** As you evaluate more agents, you discover patterns that are invisible when looking at agents individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Complex State Management: Multi-Dimensional Data** ⭐ CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "**What you learned:**\n",
        "- State isn't just `input → output`\n",
        "- State contains: test scenarios, agent configs, evaluation results, scores, metadata\n",
        "- Each node transforms and enriches the state progressively\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your state structure:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "EaaSState:\n",
        "  - target_agents: List[Dict]      # Multiple agents to coordinate\n",
        "  - evaluation_data: Dict          # Test scenarios + ground truth\n",
        "  - evaluation_results: List[Dict] # Results from all agents\n",
        "  - scores: Dict                    # Cross-agent performance metrics\n",

        "## 🎓 What to Focus On Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **State Design Patterns** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** Orchestrators live and die by their state design. You need to:\n",
        "- Understand what data flows through the system\n",
        "- Design state that captures relationships (not just inputs/outputs)\n",
        "- Plan state evolution as you add features\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Questions:**\n",
        "- What data does each node need?\n",
        "- What data does each node produce?\n",
        "- How does state get enriched as it flows through nodes?\n",
        "- What relationships need to be captured? (agent → scenario → result)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Learning:**\n",
        "- Started with simple state schema\n",
        "- Added fields as nodes needed them\n",
        "- State captures: agents, scenarios, results, scores, metadata\n",
        "- This progressive enrichment is the orchestrator pattern\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Node Responsibilities & Contracts** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** In orchestrators, nodes have clear, focused responsibilities:\n",
        "- Each node transforms state in a specific way\n",
        "- Nodes are independently testable\n",
        "- Clear contracts (reads X, writes Y) make debugging easier\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Learning:**\n",
        "- `goal_node`: Defines objective (reads config, writes goal)\n",
        "- `data_ingestion_node`: Loads data (reads path, writes evaluation_data)\n",
        "- `evaluation_execution_node`: Runs tests (reads scenarios + agents, writes results)\n",
        "- `scoring_node`: Analyzes results (reads results, writes scores)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Pattern:** Each node has a single responsibility, clear I/O contract.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Orchestration Logic: Coordinating Multiple Systems** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** Orchestrators coordinate across multiple systems/agents:\n",
        "- Need to handle multiple agents, multiple scenarios\n",
        "- Need to aggregate results across dimensions\n",
        "- Need to detect patterns across the entire system\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Learning:**\n",
        "- `evaluation_execution_node`: Loops through agents × scenarios\n",
        "- `scoring_node`: Groups results by agent, calculates cross-agent metrics\n",
        "- This coordination logic is what makes orchestrators powerful\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Incremental Development & Testing** ⭐ IMPORTANT\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** Orchestrators are complex - you need to build incrementally:\n",
        "- Test each node before moving to next\n",
        "- Smoke test before LangGraph wiring\n",
        "- Verify state flows correctly at each step\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Learning:**\n",
        "- Built nodes one at a time\n",
        "- Tested with smoke test runner\n",
        "- Only wired into LangGraph after smoke test passed\n",
        "- This caught issues early (90% of problems before graph complexity)\n",
