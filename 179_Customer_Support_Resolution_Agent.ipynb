        "\n",
        "### **1. The Big Picture**\n",
        "The RAG system takes a customer's question and finds the most relevant information from your knowledge base to help answer it. Think of it like a super-smart librarian who can instantly find the right books based on what you're asking about.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Core Components**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **A. SupportRAGSystem Class (Lines 15-45)**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class SupportRAGSystem:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, collection_name=\"support_knowledge\", ...):\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- **Sets up Chroma database**: Creates a persistent vector database to store your knowledge\n",
        "- **Loads embedding model**: Downloads `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (a lightweight AI model that converts text to numbers)\n",
        "- **Creates/loads collection**: Either creates a new knowledge base or loads an existing one\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:** This is like setting up a filing system where every piece of knowledge gets converted into a \"fingerprint\" (embedding) that can be searched by meaning, not just keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **B. load_knowledge_base() (Lines 47-85)**\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- **Reads JSON files**: Loads your `billing_kb.json` and `technical_kb.json`\n",
        "- **Processes each entry**: Takes each FAQ/policy and prepares it for search\n",
        "- **Creates embeddings**: Converts text into numerical vectors that represent meaning\n",
        "- **Stores in Chroma**: Saves everything in the vector database\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** When it processes \"How to reset password\", it converts this into a vector that's similar to \"forgot password\" or \"can't log in\" - even though the words are different!\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Takes customer query**: Like \"Why is my bill higher?\"\n",
        "- **Converts to embedding**: Turns the question into a numerical vector\n",
        "- **Searches knowledge base**: Finds the most similar knowledge entries\n",
        "- **Filters by category**: Only looks in billing or technical sections\n",
        "- **Returns ranked results**: Most relevant first, with similarity scores\n",
        "\n",
        "**The magic:** It finds \"monthly charges\" and \"billing cycle\" entries even if the customer asks \"Why is my bill higher?\" - because the meaning is similar!\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- **Weighs similarity scores**: How well does the found knowledge match the question?\n",
        "- **Considers knowledge quality**: High-confidence KB entries get more weight\n",
        "- **Returns overall score**: 0.0 (no confidence) to 1.0 (very confident)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** If it finds 3 billing entries with scores 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, it calculates a weighted average that tells us \"we're pretty confident this knowledge is relevant.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. How It All Works Together**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's trace through your test results:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Test Case 1: \"Why is my bill higher this month?\"**\n",
        "- ✅ **Query processed**: Converted to embedding\n",
        "- ❌ **No results found**: The similarity threshold (0.3) was too high\n",
        "- **Why**: The billing KB entries might not have exact matches for \"higher bill\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Test Case 2: \"I forgot my password and can't log in\"**\n",
        "- ✅ **Query processed**: Converted to embedding  \n",
        "- ✅ **Found match**: `kb_tech_002` (password reset instructions)\n",
        "- ✅ **Confidence**: 0.329 (moderate confidence)\n",
        "- **Why it worked**: \"forgot password\" semantically matches \"password reset\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Test Case 4: \"The app keeps crashing\"**\n",
        "- ✅ **Found match**: `kb_tech_003` (app crash troubleshooting)\n",
        "- ✅ **Higher confidence**: 0.527 (good confidence)\n",
        "- **Why it worked**: \"crashing\" semantically matches \"app crashes\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. The Smart Parts**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Semantic Search**\n",
        "Instead of keyword matching, it understands meaning:\n",
        "- \"bill higher\" → finds \"monthly charges\"\n",
        "- \"forgot password\" → finds \"password reset\"\n",
        "- \"app crashing\" → finds \"app crashes\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Confidence Scoring**\n",
        "It doesn't just find results - it tells us how confident it is:\n",
        "- **High confidence (0.8+)**: \"I'm very sure this answers your question\"\n",
        "- **Medium confidence (0.6-0.8)**: \"This might help, but I'm not 100% sure\"\n",
        "- **Low confidence (<0.6)**: \"I'm not confident this is right - escalate to human\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Category Filtering**\n",
        "It's smart about where to look:\n",
        "- Billing questions → only search billing knowledge\n",
        "- Technical questions → only search technical knowledge\n",
        "- This makes searches faster and more accurate\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Why This Is Powerful**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Traditional search**: \"bill\" only finds entries with the word \"bill\"\n",
        "**RAG search**: \"bill higher\" finds entries about \"monthly charges\", \"billing cycle\", \"payment amounts\" - anything semantically related!\n",
        "\n",
        "**The result**: Your support agent can understand customer questions even when they use different words than your knowledge base, making it much more helpful and accurate.\n",
