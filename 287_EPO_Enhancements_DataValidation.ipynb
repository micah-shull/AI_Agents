        "1. Risk reduction: Without statistical tests, you can’t tell if a 44% lift is real or noise. A CEO scaling based on noise can waste resources and damage credibility.\n",
        "2. Industry standard: Executives expect statistical validation. Presenting results without it weakens the case.\n",
        "3. Decision confidence: P-values quantify uncertainty. “44% lift, p=0.0028” means there’s a 0.28% chance it’s random—actionable. “44% lift, medium confidence” is vague.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. Board/executive credibility\n",
        "- Executives and boards expect statistical rigor\n",
        "- Presenting results without it can undermine trust\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. ROI justification\n",
        "- Statistical significance + ROI = stronger business case\n",
