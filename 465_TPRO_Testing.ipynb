        "\n",
        "Each report section:\n",
        "\n",
        "* is independently testable\n",
        "* has clear inputs\n",
        "* produces deterministic outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "* sections can evolve independently\n",
        "* LLM polish can be added later without risk\n",
        "* governance teams won’t panic when things change\n",

        "* content presence\n",
        "* numeric inclusion\n",
        "* structural integrity\n",
        "* file persistence\n",
        "\n",
        "That matters because **risk systems must be auditable**.\n",
        "This suite proves traceability from:\n",
