        "## 1) Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mission Control** is the central coordination layer in a multi-agent system that aligns specialized agents to **measurable business missions** (e.g., onboarding time, sales velocity, support resolution).\n",
        "Unlike one-off “do a task” agents, Mission Control manages an **end-to-end workflow**: decomposes the mission, routes tasks to the right agents, enforces dependencies and HITL gates, monitors progress, and measures outcomes against KPIs.\n",

        "### What v2 adds (minimal data, maximum leverage)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Execution history (“runs”)**: track what happened, not just what *should* happen.\n",
        "2. **Task telemetry**: durations, outcomes, approvals, delays.\n",
        "3. **Risk & governance signals**: detect drift from plan, SLA risk, repeated approvals/escalations.\n",
        "4. **Dynamic routing**: choose agents based on lightweight performance stats (not just static capability mapping).\n",
        "5. **Portfolio snapshot**: a CEO-ready view across missions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What v2 intentionally does NOT add (yet)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Complex simulation, massive event streams, deep probabilistic planning, fully autonomous multi-mission scheduling, or expensive LLM-decisioning. v2 stays rule-first with optional LLM “polish.”\n",
