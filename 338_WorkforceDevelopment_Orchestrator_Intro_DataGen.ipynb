        "\n",
        "**Recommendation: JSON as primary format**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:**\n",

        "## 🎯 Key Design Principles\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent Architecture First**\n",
        "   - Data structure supports agent workflow\n",
        "   - Easy to load into state (Dict[str, Any])\n",
        "   - Supports progressive state enrichment\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **MVP Simplicity**\n",
        "   - Enough complexity to demonstrate patterns\n",
        "   - Not so much that it becomes a data problem\n",
        "   - Can manually verify results\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extensibility**\n",
        "   - Structure allows adding fields later\n",
        "   - Can add more employees/roles without breaking\n",
        "   - Supports future LLM enhancement\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Explainability**\n",
        "   - Risk factors explain automation scores\n",
        "   - Clear relationships between entities\n",
        "   - Traceable recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✅ Final Recommendation Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tell ChatGPT:**\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Defaults are good, with these adjustments:**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 1. **Format: JSON (primary)** - Matches our agent architecture patterns\n",
        "> 2. **Scope: ~15-20 employees, 3-4 departments, 5-6 roles** - Lean but demonstrative\n",
        "> 3. **Industry: Generic knowledge-work** - Transferable and familiar\n",
        "> 4. **Automation Risk: Both numeric (0.0-1.0) + categorical (low/medium/high)** - For modeling and executives\n",
        "> 5. **Learning Content: Yes, but lightweight** - Course titles, tracks, time estimates, prerequisites only\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Additional Request:**\n",
        "> - Include `risk_factors` array in tasks (for explainability)\n",
        "> - Include `future_skills` in roles (for gap detection)\n",
        "> - Structure data to support progressive state enrichment\n",
        "> - Make relationships clear (employee → role → tasks → skills)\n",

        "## 🔗 Integration Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "**For Agent Development:**\n",
        "- Data files go in `data/` directory\n",
        "- Load using utilities in `utilities/data_loading.py`\n",
        "- State schema will include fields like:\n",
        "  - `employees: List[Dict[str, Any]]`\n",
        "  - `roles_lookup: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]`\n",
        "  - `tasks_by_role: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]`\n",
        "  - `skill_gaps: List[Dict[str, Any]]`\n",
        "\n",
        "**State Enrichment Pattern:**\n",
        "1. Load raw data → `employees`, `roles`, `tasks`\n",
        "2. Build lookups → `roles_lookup`, `tasks_by_role`\n",
        "3. Analyze → `automation_risks`, `skill_gaps`\n",
        "4. Generate → `learning_paths`, `role_evolution_suggestions`\n",
