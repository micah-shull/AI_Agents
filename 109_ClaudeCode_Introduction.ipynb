        "# What Is Claude Code?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Claude Code** is Anthropic’s AI-powered, agentic coding assistant that runs right from your **terminal**. It integrates deeply with your existing workflows and tools—like GitHub, Git, CI systems, databases, deployment services, and more—to let you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Walk through and understand entire codebases\n",
        "* Turn plain-language prompts into code changes, PRs, or feature implementations\n",
        "* Debug, refactor, or triage issues in one seamless flow\n",
        "* Automate repetitive tasks like linting, committing, or writing release notes—all without leaving your terminal ([Anthropic][1])\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s designed to blend into your already existing setup rather than drag you into another interface ([Anthropic][1], [Anthropic][2]).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Makes It Special?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Terminal-first, not chat-first**\n",
        "   Claude Code is built on the principle of *working where developers already are*, directly within IDEs and terminals. That means minimal context-switching and more productivity ([Anthropic][2]).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Agentic multitasking across your codebase**\n",
        "   It can write multi-file edits, execute commands, create commits, and even connect to external tools via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—extending its reach into databases, Figma, Slack, Jira, etc. ([Anthropic][2]).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Built for complex, real-world development**\n",
        "   Used by engineering teams at Intercom, Ramp, and others, Claude Code is credited with saving days of work on common development tasks—from onboarding to feature implementation ([Anthropic][1]).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Powered by Claude models—optimized for coding**\n",
        "   Claude Code embeds cutting-edge models such as *Claude Opus 4.1* and *Sonnet 4*, optimized for reasoning, code generation, and reliability. These models are praised in industry for coding accuracy, context awareness, and privacy safeguards ([Wikipedia][3]).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Caution and reliability matters**\n",
        "   While very powerful, Claude Code isn’t foolproof. Real-world users have experienced occasional problems—like losing context during long sessions or unintentionally deleting critical files—so best practices like frequent backups and active supervision are strongly advised ([Business Insider][4]).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Why Anthropic built it**\n",
        "   Beyond helping developers, Claude Code gives Anthropic high-quality feedback from real terminal workflows, which helps improve model training and maintain a lead in AI-powered coding tools ([Business Insider][5]).\n",
