        "1. Theme frequency inflation: \"32 occurrences\" is misleading — entries can match multiple themes, so counts overlap.\n",
        "2. Priority scores are clustered (many 79.5, 78.0, 73.5) — needs better differentiation.\n",
        "3. Theme detection is too broad — keywords like \"time\" and \"slow\" match too many entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommended improvements (priority order):\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Fix theme detection and frequency calculation (high impact)\n",
        "- Problem: Entries match multiple themes, inflating counts.\n",
        "- Solution: Use exclusive theme assignment (best match) or count unique entries per theme.\n",

        "2) Add actionable recommendations (high value)\n",
        "- Problem: Report identifies issues but doesn't suggest actions.\n",
        "- Solution: Add an LLM-based recommendation generator that suggests specific actions per issue/idea.\n",
        "- Impact: More actionable for leadership.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Improve prioritization score differentiation (medium)\n",
        "- Problem: Scores are too similar.\n",
        "- Solution: Refine scoring weights, add department impact weighting, and consider cross-department effects.\n",
        "- Impact: Clearer ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Add time-based trend analysis (medium)\n",
        "- Problem: Timestamps aren't used.\n",
        "- Solution: Analyze trends over time (e.g., weekly), detect emerging issues, and show improvement/decline.\n",
        "- Impact: Better insights into patterns and changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Enhance theme detection with LLM semantic grouping (medium)\n",
        "- Problem: Keyword matching is too broad.\n",
        "- Solution: Use LLM for semantic similarity to group related feedback more accurately.\n",
        "- Impact: More precise themes.\n",
