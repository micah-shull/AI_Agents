        "The **Marketing Orchestrator** is an AI system that coordinates campaign planning, content generation, audience targeting, experimentation, and performance evaluation across the marketing lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than optimizing individual assets (emails, ads, posts) in isolation, this orchestrator:\n",
        "\n",
        "* models marketing as a **continuous, stateful workflow**\n",
        "* coordinates multiple specialist agents (content, segmentation, analytics)\n",
        "* adapts campaigns dynamically based on real-time signals\n",
        "* integrates experimentation and evaluation as first-class features\n",
        "* ensures governance, brand safety, and human oversight\n",

        "Marketing teams often struggle with:\n",
        "\n",
        "* fragmented tools and data\n",
        "* slow feedback loops between campaigns and results\n",
        "* content that scales in volume but not relevance\n",
        "* experimentation that is ad hoc and poorly measured\n",
        "* difficulty connecting spend to outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "The Marketing Orchestrator addresses these issues by transforming marketing from a sequence of disconnected activities into a **coordinated, measurable system**.\n",
