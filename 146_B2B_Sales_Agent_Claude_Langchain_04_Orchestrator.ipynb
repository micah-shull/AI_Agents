        "\n",
        "### 1. **Unified Framework Across Agents**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The orchestrator coordinates `LangChainResearchAgent`, `LangChainAnalysisAgent`, and `LangChainPersonalizationAgent` — all built on the same LangChain abstractions.\n",
        "* This means each step shares a **common interface** (schemas, `LLMChain`, templates), so the orchestrator just plugs them together.\n",
        "* In the original, each agent had bespoke logic; here, everything is normalized.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Structured State & Monitoring**\n",

        "* Uses `WorkflowState`, `WorkflowStep`, `WorkflowStatus`, and `AgentStatus` models from your `langchain_models.py`.\n",
        "* Every run produces a **structured log**: start/end time, retries, error messages, outputs.\n",
        "* This is invaluable for debugging, analytics, and plugging into LangSmith observability.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Each step is wrapped in try/except with its own `FAILED` status and error message.\n",
        "* Steps can be retried with backoff (`retry_failed_step`) instead of re-running the entire workflow.\n",
        "* Original code had linear \"all-or-nothing\" execution — now you get granular fault tolerance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "### 4. **Composable Pipelines**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Workflow steps are defined as configs (`workflow_steps`) instead of hardcoding.\n",
        "* Easy to add new agents: e.g. a `ValidationAgent` or `SummaryAgent` without rewriting core logic.\n",
        "* Makes this feel more like a *pipeline engine* than just procedural glue code.\n",
