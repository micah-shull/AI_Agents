        "## 1. Why Policy Evaluation Is Separated from the Orchestrator\n",
        "\n",
        "A key design choice here is that **policy logic lives outside the main agent flow**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates three important advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Clarity** — policies are enforced consistently, not implicitly\n",
        "2. **Testability** — policy behavior can be validated independently\n",
        "3. **Governance credibility** — rules can be reviewed by legal, compliance, or leadership without reading the entire agent\n",
        "\n",
        "This mirrors how real enterprises implement governance:\n",
        "policy engines are isolated, controlled, and heavily scrutinized.\n",

        "### `check_condition(...)`\n",
        "\n",
        "This function is the **policy interpreter**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of hardcoding business logic into the agent, policies express conditions declaratively (e.g., `\"confidence_score_lt\": 0.6`), and this function translates those conditions into concrete checks against real events.\n",

        "\n",

        "* Threshold checks (low confidence, large deal size)\n",
        "* Ethical safeguards (protected attributes in HR decisions)\n",
        "* Transparency enforcement (missing explanations)\n",
        "* List-based matching (multiple action types)\n",
        "* Nested inputs (region, customer segment)\n",

        "> *“Does this policy apply to this event, and if so, was it violated?”*\n",
        "\n",
        "It does this in three clear steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Condition Matching\n",
        "\n",
        "All policy conditions are evaluated and recorded — not just whether the policy matched, but *why*.\n",

        "* A clear audit trail\n",
        "* Debuggable evaluations\n",
        "* Human-readable reasoning\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Violation Determination\n",
        "\n",
        "A violation is **not** assumed just because a policy applies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, the code checks whether the **required governance action** was actually taken:\n",

        "\n",
        "### 🔹 Human Oversight Is First-Class\n",
