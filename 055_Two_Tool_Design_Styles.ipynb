        "### 📊 Data Consistency\n",
        "- The fixed schema ensures that invoice data is always structured the same way.\n",
        "- This makes it easier to integrate with downstream systems like:\n",
        "  - Databases\n",
        "  - Accounting software\n",
        "  - Analytics pipelines\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔒 Required Fields\n",
        "- You can define critical fields as `required` in the schema.\n",
        "- If a required field is missing, the tool can raise an error — helping you catch issues early.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧪 Field Validation\n",
        "- The schema can specify data formats and constraints:\n",
        "  - Dates in proper format\n",
        "  - Numbers within ranges\n",
        "  - Strings with specific patterns\n",
        "- This prevents garbage data from creeping into your systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Focused Prompting\n",
        "- The prompt can be written specifically for invoices:\n",
        "  - “Look for invoice number near the top”\n",
