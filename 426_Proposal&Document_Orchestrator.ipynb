        "\n",
        "The **Proposal & Document Orchestrator** is an AI system that coordinates the creation, review, validation, and continuous improvement of high-stakes business documents such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* proposals and RFP responses\n",
        "* client-facing reports\n",
        "* compliance and policy documents\n",
        "* contracts and statements of work\n",
        "* internal strategy and decision memos\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than generating documents as one-off text outputs, this orchestrator treats document creation as a **structured, multi-step workflow** with explicit quality controls, evaluation criteria, human review points, and measurable outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It functions as a **document production control system**, not a text generator.\n",
