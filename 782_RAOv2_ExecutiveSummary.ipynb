        "### **What this is**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **continuous revenue integrity system** that ensures your business is collecting every dollar it has earned—while identifying both **revenue leakage (loss)** and **untapped upside (opportunity)** in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why CEOs value this agent**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **It protects revenue without adding headcount**\n",
        "\n",
        "Most organizations assume billing and revenue processes are working correctly—but small errors compound into **significant financial leakage over time**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Continuously reconciles **contracts, invoices, and usage**\n",
        "* Detects pricing errors, missed charges, and compliance gaps\n",

        "\n",
        "Traditional reports show numbers. This system answers:\n",
