        "- Add `created_at` (ISO 8601 format: `\"2026-01-10T14:30:00Z\"`) to ALL files\n",

        "When generating the actual data files, ensure:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Realistic Workflows:**\n",
        "   - Include documents that pass all stages (happy path)\n",
        "   - Include documents that fail compliance and require revisions\n",
        "   - Include documents with multiple review cycles\n",
        "   - Include documents with human overrides\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Time Realism:**\n",
        "   - Stage durations should be realistic (5-60 minutes, not seconds)\n",
        "   - Review times should vary by role (legal: 15-30 min, sales: 5-15 min)\n",
        "   - Cycle times should show improvement over baseline (e.g., 36h vs 72h)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cost Realism:**\n",
        "   - LLM costs: $0.50 - $5.00 per document (depending on complexity)\n",
        "   - Human review costs: $30 - $150 per document (based on role × time)\n",
        "   - Tooling costs: $0.10 - $1.00 per document\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Volume:**\n",
        "   - 10-15 documents minimum (enough for meaningful KPIs)\n",
        "   - Mix of document types (proposals, policies, reports)\n",
        "   - Mix of priorities (high, medium, low)\n",
        "   - Mix of outcomes (submitted, approved, rejected, in_progress)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-File Consistency:**\n",
        "   - All `document_id` references must exist in `documents.json`\n",
        "   - All `version_id` references must exist in `document_versions.json`\n",
        "   - Timestamps should be chronologically consistent (version 2 created after version 1)\n",
        "   - Stage sequences should be logical (compliance_check after content_generation)\n",
