        "- Avoided architectural mistakes\n",
        "- Clear understanding of node responsibilities\n",

        "**What:** Started with templates/defaults/dummy data, then replaced incrementally  \n",

        "**What:** Guide mentioned folder structure, but we created it mid-way  \n",

        "- Had to reorganize files slightly\n",
        "- Slightly unclear where files should go initially\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Dependency Management**\n",
        "**What:** We added `tavily-python` to requirements.txt, but didn't install until later  \n",
        "**Impact:**\n",
        "- Could have caught import errors earlier\n",
        "- Had to remember to install dependencies\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. **Virtual Environment Awareness**\n",
        "**What:** User wasn't sure if `(.venv)` meant they were in venv  \n",

        "- Brief confusion about where packages were installed\n",
        "- Could have installed globally by mistake\n",

        "**Impact:**\n",
        "- Could have set it up earlier\n",
        "- Not critical, but could streamline\n",
        "\n",

        "- Had to adapt the order\n",
        "\n",

        "---\n",

        "**Impact:**\n",
        "- Had to discuss/debate this during scaffold\n",
        "- Not a problem, but could be clearer\n",
