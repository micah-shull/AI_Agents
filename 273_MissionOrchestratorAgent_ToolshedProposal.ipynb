        "```python\n",
        "# GOOD: Configurable\n",
        "def calculate_progress(completed: int, total: int, format: str = \"percentage\") -> float:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **3. Pure Functions When Possible**\n",
        "```python\n",

        "- **Improvement:** Consistent, battle-tested code\n",

        "## Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The toolshed provides **foundational components** that appear in virtually every orchestrator agent:\n",
        "- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows\n",
        "- Progress tracking\n",
        "- KPI monitoring\n",
        "- Report generation\n",
        "- Task dependency resolution\n",
        "- Agent selection patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "## Philosophy\n",
        "\n",
        "**Configuration Over Code** - Utilities are configurable, not hard-coded  \n",
        "**Composition Over Inheritance** - Use utilities as building blocks  \n",
        "**Pure Functions When Possible** - Easier to test and reuse  \n",
        "**Clear Boundaries** - Generic patterns, not domain-specific logic\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from toolshed.hitl import create_approval_request, process_approval\n",
        "from toolshed.progress import calculate_progress, calculate_elapsed_time\n",
        "from toolshed.kpi import calculate_kpi_metrics, assess_kpi_status\n",

        "# Use in your agent\n",
