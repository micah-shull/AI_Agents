        "### Pattern Detection First Because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Demonstrates Value Immediately**\n",
        "   - You'll see: \"Oh! Both agents fail on neutral sentiment\"\n",
        "   - This is the orchestrator \"aha!\" moment\n",

        "   - This is core orchestrator skill\n",
        "   - Pattern detection = orchestrator superpower\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Informs State Design**\n",
        "   - As you build pattern detection, you'll see what state you need\n",
        "   - \"I need scenario metadata to detect patterns\"\n",
        "   - \"I need to group results by scenario type\"\n",
        "   - State design becomes clearer through practice\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Informs Execution Design**\n",
        "   - Once you know what patterns you want, you can design better execution\n",
        "   - \"I need to capture confidence scores for pattern detection\"\n",
        "   - \"I need to track which scenario categories fail\"\n",

        "### Execution Node Second Because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **You Know What You Need**\n",
        "   - After building pattern detection, you know what data to capture\n",
        "   - You can design execution to provide that data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Orchestration Logic is Simpler**\n",
        "   - The coordination (agents × scenarios) is already there\n",
        "   - You're just making it more realistic\n",
        "   - Less conceptual, more implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **State Design is Clearer**\n",
