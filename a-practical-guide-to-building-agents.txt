## ðŸ§¾ Summary: A Practical Guide to Building Agents

### ðŸ”¹ What Is an Agent?
An **agent** is a system that performs multi-step tasks on your behalf using an LLM. Unlike traditional automation or simple chatbots, agents can:
- **Independently manage workflows**
- **Make decisions**, detect when a task is complete, and handle errors or unexpected conditions
- **Use tools dynamically** to gather data and take action
- Operate within **guardrails** to ensure safe and predictable behavior

> ðŸ§  **Key Idea**: Agents donâ€™t just assistâ€”they act *on your behalf* with autonomy.

### ðŸ”¹ When Should You Build an Agent?
Agents shine in workflows where traditional automation struggles:
1. **Complex Decision-Making**: Context-aware tasks like refund approvals.
2. **Hard-to-Maintain Rules**: Situations with complicated, brittle rule systems (e.g., security reviews).
3. **Unstructured Data**: Tasks involving language understanding, document analysis, or conversational input (e.g., insurance claims).

Before building, ask: *Is the workflow too ambiguous, dynamic, or context-rich for rule-based automation?*

> âœ… If yes â€” an agent may be the better solution.
