        "\n",
        "1. **Rule-Based Foundation** - All enhancements should be rule-based first, LLM-enhanced second\n",
        "2. **Toolshed Integration** - Leverage existing toolshed utilities (kpi, statistics, hitl, etc.)\n",
        "3. **Graceful Degradation** - System should work even if enhancements fail\n",
        "4. **Transparency** - All recommendations should be explainable\n",
        "5. **Measurability** - Track impact of each enhancement\n",
        "6. **HITL Safety** - High-impact actions require human approval\n",

        "1. Start with Priority 1 (Actionable Recommendations) - highest ROI, medium effort\n",
        "2. Build incrementally - test each enhancement before moving to next\n",
        "3. Measure impact - track ROI improvement from each enhancement\n",
        "4. Iterate based on feedback - adjust based on what works\n"
