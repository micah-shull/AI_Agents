        "- **Resolve references** (e.g., “What’s the weather there?” → knows what “there” means)\n",

        "\n",
        "- **File-Based Storage** Persisting dictionary data to JSON or CSV files for simple long-term storag.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Databases** Using relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases to store structured data, allowing for efficient querying and scalabilit.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vector Stores** Implementing vector databases like FAISS or Pinecone to store and retrieve data based on semantic similarity, enhancing the agent's ability to recall relevant informatio.\n",
