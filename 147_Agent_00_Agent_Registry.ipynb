        "- **Find alternative agents** (if multiple agents have same capability)\n",

        "- Like hiring one person for your team\n",

        "### **🛠️ Capabilities = The Skills That Worker Has**  \n",

        "- Like saying \"this person can do accounting, project management, and data analysis\"\n",

        "- Internal functions, APIs, libraries the agent calls\n",
        "- Like saying \"this accountant uses Excel, QuickBooks, and calculators\"\n",
        "\n",

        "### **Option 1: Multi-Capability Agents (Swiss Army Knife)**\n",

        "  ├── document_analysis capability  \n",
        "  └── competitive_analysis capability\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Pros:** Fewer agents to manage, related skills grouped together\n",
        "**Cons:** Agents become complex, harder to test individual capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Option 2: Single-Capability Agents (Specialists)**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "WebResearchAgent: web_research capability only\n",
        "DocumentAnalysisAgent: document_analysis capability only  \n",
        "CompetitiveAnalysisAgent: competitive_analysis capability only\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Pros:** Simple, focused agents; easy to test and replace\n",
        "**Cons:** More agents to manage; potential code duplication\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why This Matters for Orchestration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# The orchestrator thinks in terms of capabilities, not agent names\n",
        "orchestrator.find_task_handler(\"web_research\")  # Returns ANY agent that can do this\n",
        "# Could return: ResearchAgent, WebResearchAgent, or SuperResearchAgent\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This enables:\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Swap agents without changing workflows\n",
        "- **Redundancy**: Multiple agents can have the same capability  \n",
        "- **Auto-routing**: Orchestrator finds the right agent automatically\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Which Approach Should You Use?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**I recommend starting with single-capability agents** because:\n",
        "1. Easier to build and test\n",
        "2. More modular (true \"tools in toolshed\")\n",
        "3. Easier to understand the orchestration logic\n",
        "4. You can always combine them later\n",
        "\n",
        "**Questions for you:**\n",
        "1. Do you see the difference between agent, capability, and tools now?\n",
        "2. Are you leaning toward specialist agents or multi-capability agents?\n",
        "3. What capabilities do you think you'll need for your use case?\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Agent Versioning & Updates**\n",
        "- **Hot-swapping**: Replace agent v1.0 with v1.1 without downtime\n",
        "- **A/B testing**: Run old and new agent versions side-by-side\n",
        "- **Rollback**: If new version fails, instantly revert to previous\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Health Monitoring**\n",
        "- **Proactive checks**: Detect failing agents before they break workflows\n",
        "- **Auto-recovery**: Restart failed agents automatically\n",
        "- **Circuit breakers**: Stop using agents that fail repeatedly\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Registry Analytics**\n",
        "- **Capacity planning**: \"We need 3 more research agents\"\n",
        "- **Performance trends**: \"Research agents are getting 20% slower\"\n",
        "- **Cost optimization**: \"Switch to cheaper agents for non-critical tasks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🔮 Advanced Features (Later):**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Agent Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across identical agents\n",
        "- **Geographic Distribution**: Route tasks to agents in specific regions\n",
        "- **Resource Quotas**: Limit how much compute/cost each agent can use\n",
        "- **Agent Marketplaces**: Dynamically discover and use third-party agents\n",
        "\n",
        "## **💡 Key Takeaway:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Start simple** (like our basic registry), but **design for these needs**. Don't over-engineer now, but make sure your architecture can evolve to handle:\n",

        "**Should we dive into how workflows actually get executed?** This is where you'll see all the registry metadata come together to make intelligent routing decisions in real-time! 🚀"
