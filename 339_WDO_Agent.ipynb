        "\n",
        "This section defines the **contract** that governs how the Workforce Development Orchestrator thinks, reasons, and produces outcomes. Rather than hiding logic inside opaque model calls, the design makes every major decision point explicit, inspectable, and configurable.\n",
        "\n",
        "At a high level, this code does two things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Defines a **transparent, auditable state object** that all agent nodes read from and write to\n",
        "2. Defines a **CEO-friendly configuration layer** that controls thresholds, priorities, and behavior without changing code\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these form the backbone of a rules-driven, executive-ready AI system.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `WorkforceDevelopmentOrchestratorState` is not just a data container — it is the **shared memory and decision ledger** for the entire agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every node in the orchestrator:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reads from this state\n",
        "* Adds structured results back into it\n",
        "* Leaves an auditable trail of how conclusions were reached\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures the system remains **deterministic, explainable, and testable**.\n",
        "\n",

        "Instead of letting decisions emerge implicitly from a single model call, the agent:\n",

        "* Separates *data ingestion*, *analysis*, *prioritization*, and *reporting*\n",
