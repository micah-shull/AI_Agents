        "\n",
        "This module contains the analytical core of the Predictive Revenue Gap Orchestrator. Its purpose is to proactively **detect early signs of revenue leakage and churn risk** at the individual customer level — before losses appear in financial reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is intentionally **rule-based and interpretable**, making it ideal for MVP validation, stakeholder trust-building, and iterative refinement.\n",

        "\n",
        "## ✅ What This Module Does\n",
        "\n",
        "For each customer, it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Analyzes recent spending behavior\n",
        "2. Compares it against historical baseline expectations\n",
        "3. Detects meaningful negative changes in revenue\n",
        "4. Flags potential churn events (e.g., zero-spend weeks)\n",
        "5. Assigns severity levels and contextual explanations\n",
        "6. Produces structured outputs for downstream orchestration\n",
        "\n",
        "This transforms raw weekly sales records into business-ready intelligence.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1️⃣ Declining Revenue Trend\n",
        "\n",
        "Triggered when spend is decreasing consistently over time and exceeds a configurable threshold (default: −15%).\n",
        "\n",
        "Signals:\n",
        "\n",
        "* competitor defection\n",

        "\n",
        "Identifies customers who have stopped purchasing altogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "Triggered when the customer has multiple zero-spend weeks within the recent window (default: ≥2 of last 4 weeks).\n",

        "## 📉 Churn Risk Scoring\n",
        "\n",

        "* number of recent zero-spend weeks\n",

        "1. **Analyzes recent spending behavior**\n",

        "\n",
        "Once revenue gaps and recovery opportunities have been identified, the orchestrator must determine **which customers the business should act on first**. The scoring utilities provide that prioritization layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "This module converts qualitative signals — severity, churn risk, customer value, and potential recovery — into a **single, comparable numerical score**, enabling ranking, triage, and automated decision-making.\n",

        "## ✅ What This Module Does\n",
        "\n",
        "For every detected revenue gap, it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Evaluates financial impact\n",
        "2. Incorporates churn risk likelihood\n",
        "3. Considers customer lifetime value\n",
        "4. Assesses probability of successful recovery\n",
        "5. Applies configurable weighting\n",
        "6. Produces a final prioritization score (0–10)\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1️⃣ Revenue Impact Score\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures how large the gap is relative to the customer’s historical revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "➡️ Prioritizes high-value losses over small fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2️⃣ Churn Risk Score\n",
        "\n",
        "Derived from prior churn risk assessment.\n",

        "➡️ Protects profitable, loyal, or strategic customers.\n",

        "Estimated ease of winning back the revenue based on opportunity type and severity.\n",
