        "**Why:** Leaders think in business units. “How is Sales vs HR vs Ops?” is the first question.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What to add:**\n",
        "- **By-department block** using `departments` + `workforce_risk_controls`: name, headcount, criticality, displacement_risk_pct, retraining_coverage_pct, fairness_flag, regulatory_exposure.\n",

        "- In analysis: one utility that builds a “department_summary” list (from departments + workforce_risk_controls, optionally aggregating role-level risk/gaps per department).  \n",

        "- **Cost-of-inaction** – e.g., “Closing top 3 gaps: ~$4.5K training (from training_investments-style data); estimated productivity uplift Y%.”\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**What to add:**\n",
        "- **Readiness over time** – e.g., “Sales: 63 → 71 (Q1→Q2); Operations: 68 → 74.”\n",
        "- **Reskilling progress** – e.g., “Reskilling progress by department: 31% → 48% (Sales).”\n",

        "- In analysis: utility that takes `workforce_snapshots`, groups by department (and optionally run_id/date), computes deltas or latest vs previous.  \n",

        "**Why:** CEOs want to know “If we go fast vs slow on AI, what happens?”\n",
        "\n",
        "**What to add:**\n",
        "- **Use `workforce_scenarios`** – e.g., “Under **AI Acceleration** (12 months): Sales & Operations most affected; $250K training budget; hiring freeze. Under **Gradual Transformation** (18 months): HR & Analytics; $140K; no freeze.”\n",
        "- **Recommendation** – e.g., “If pursuing AI Acceleration, prioritize reskilling in Sales and Operations and lock L&D budget.”\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation:**  \n",
        "- In reporting: one “Scenarios” subsection that reads `workforce_scenarios` from state and renders the two (or N) scenarios in a short table + 1–2 sentences. No new analysis needed if data is already loaded.\n",
