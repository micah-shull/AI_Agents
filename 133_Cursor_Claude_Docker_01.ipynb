        "**Cursor** is an AI-powered code editor and autonomous agent system developed by Anysphere. It's essentially a fork of Visual Studio Code (so you‚Äôll find the interface familiar) but supercharged with AI features that let you program via natural language prompts. It supports intelligent autocompletion, smart bulk edits, codebase querying, and full-context understanding‚Äîall right in your editor.([Wikipedia][1], [The Verge][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent updates introduced **Cursor Agents**, powerful AI assistants that can autonomously carry out tasks across devices‚Äîfrom web and mobile‚Äîletting you initiate tasks, monitor progress, and review results via a sleek interface.([Cursor][3], [Analytics Vidhya][4])\n",

        "* **File-level operations**: You can manipulate non-code files (.csv, .txt) via prompts‚Äîhandy for data wrangling.([Towards AI][6])\n",
        "* **End-to-end agent workflow**: Let an agent scaffold boilerplate, write functions, apply changes, document, then review the diffs to merge.([Analytics Vidhya][4], [DEV Community][8])\n",
        "* **Seamless collaboration**: Integrates with GitHub and Slack‚ÄîCursor Agents can create PRs or notify you when a task finishes.([Cursor][3], [Analytics Vidhya][4], [Just Think][9])\n",

        "Here‚Äôs a practical roadmap to try Cursor agents in your data science workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Sign Up and Configure**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Head to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/agents) and create an account.\n",
        "* Link your GitHub repo(s) so agents can access your project context.([Analytics Vidhya][4])\n",

        "* You can monitor progress in real time, view diffs, and approve or modify changes.\n",

        "* Continue tasks from your phone or tablet‚ÄîCursor Agents run in the background while you commute or step away.([Analytics Vidhya][4], [Just Think][9])\n",
        "* Notifications via Slack can let you know when your agent has completed a task.([Cursor][3])\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Iterate and Keep Control**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Always review the proposed code changes‚ÄîAI is powerful but needs human oversight.([Towards AI][6], [Analytics Vidhya][4])\n",
        "* Provide a technical spec (even a quick UML or sketch) for better results, especially in early tasks.([Towards AI][6])\n",
        "* Use branches and PRs to manage changes safely.\n",

        "### 5. **Advance to More Complex Tasks**\n",

        "* Try building a complete feature pipeline: from data ingestion to feature engineering and testing.\n",
        "* Ask agents to write tests or documentation automatically.([Towards AI][6], [Analytics Vidhya][4])\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **(Optional) Explore Control Loops with Tools**\n",
        "\n",
