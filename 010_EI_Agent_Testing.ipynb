It is calculated by calculating the average of the government's debt payments over a period of 10 years. This information is important to economists and investors because it helps them understand the health of the economy and how it is affected by various factors such as inflation, interest rates, and government spending. The 10-Year Treasury Yield can also provide insight into the overall health of the economy, as it can indicate the level of debt servicing and the overall economic health of a country\n",
