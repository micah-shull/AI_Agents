        "\n",
        "Rather than focusing on single tasks like generating ads or emails, this agent models marketing as a **continuous, stateful decision system**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* campaigns evolve based on real performance\n",
        "* budgets shift toward winning channels\n",
        "* experiments drive learning\n",

        "* human approvals enforce governance\n",
        "* ROI is tracked transparently\n",
        "\n",
        "V2 extends the original MVP by adding **journey-stage intelligence, budget governance, risk signals, segment-level portfolio views, and attribution hints**—without sacrificing architectural clarity or explainability.\n",
        "\n",
