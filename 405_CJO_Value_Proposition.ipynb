        "Why it matters:\n",
        "- Predictable, testable, debuggable\n",
        "- No black-box decisions\n",
        "- Reproducible results\n",
        "- Audit trail for every decision\n",
        "\n",
        "CEO value: Trust and accountability. Executives can understand and explain how decisions are made, which is critical for governance and compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Three-tier KPI framework\n",
        "Why it matters:\n",
        "- Operational KPIs: \"Is the system working?\"\n",
        "- Effectiveness KPIs: \"Is the journey improving?\"\n",
        "- Business KPIs: \"Is this worth the investment?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "CEO value: Clear measurement of system health, customer impact, and business value. Answers \"Is this working?\" and \"Is it worth it?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. ROI calculation and transparency\n",
        "Why it matters:\n",
        "- Transparent cost breakdown (LLM, API, human time, infrastructure)\n",
        "- Value components (churn prevention, escalation reduction, revenue preserved)\n",
        "- Net benefit calculation\n",
        "- Assumption-based and testable\n",
        "\n",
        "CEO value: Quantifies business impact. Example: 827% ROI with $4,549.96 net benefit provides a clear business case.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Generates targeted intervention recommendations\n",
        "- Calculates confidence and priority scores\n",

        "- Estimates revenue saved per intervention\n",
        "- Closes the feedback loop\n",

        "Why it matters:\n",
        "- Detailed report: Full metrics, KPIs, breakdowns\n",
        "- Executive summary: LLM-generated, 200-300 words, highlights key insights\n",
        "\n",
        "CEO value: Time-efficient insights. Executives get quick summaries; analysts get full details.\n",

        "### 8. Journey state evaluation\n",
        "Why it matters:\n",
        "- Models customer journey as stateful workflow\n",
        "- Detects friction points (time in state, signal patterns)\n",

        "- Quantifies ROI (e.g., 827% ROI, $4,549.96 net benefit)\n",
        "- Tracks revenue preserved ($4,800 in your test)\n",
        "- Measures churn reduction and CSAT improvement\n",
        "- Connects actions to outcomes\n",
