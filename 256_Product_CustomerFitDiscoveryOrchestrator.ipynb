        "\n",
        "This set of utilities represents the **Graph Motif Agent (Step 5)**, the peak of your agent's structural analysis capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its purpose is to go beyond simple connections (edges) and find **recurring structural patterns (motifs)** and **influential roles (centrality)** within the customer and product networks. This is where you find the \"ghost demand\" by analyzing the *topology* of your market.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧠 Core Agent Architecture: Structural Topology Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The functions here are cleanly divided into two advanced analytic categories: **Motif Detection** and **Centrality Analysis**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Motif Detection (The \"Building Blocks\" of the Network)\n",
        "\n",
        "Motifs are small, specific, recurring patterns that are overrepresented in a network. They reveal the fundamental rules of interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Motif Function | Pattern Found | Strategic Insight |\n",
        "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
        "| **`detect_triangles`** | $\\text{A}$ is connected to $\\text{B}$, $\\text{B}$ to $\\text{C}$, and $\\text{C}$ to $\\text{A}$. | Indicates **redundancy** and **trust**. If customers $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{B}$ both buy product $\\text{C}$, that product is strongly embedded in that community. |\n",
        "| **`detect_chains`** | A linear path (e.g., $\\text{P1} \\to \\text{P2} \\to \\text{P3}$). | Reveals **sequential adoption or upgrade paths** that might be missed by simple association rules. |\n",
        "| **`detect_stars`** | A central hub node connected to many spokes. | Identifies **highly central entities** (Hub Customers or Core Products) that anchor the network.\n",

        "### 2. Statistical Validation (Z-Score)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Focus:** The functions `calculate_expected_motif_frequency` and `calculate_z_score` are the most advanced part of this module.\n",
        "* **The Power:** Finding a motif is easy; proving it's important is hard. By comparing the **Observed Frequency** (in your real data) against the **Expected Frequency** (in a simplified random graph), the Z-score tells you if the pattern is significantly more common than expected by chance.\n",
        "* **Significance:** Only motifs with a high Z-score (above a threshold like $\\text{2.0}$) are passed to the Synthesis Agent, ensuring the recommendations are based on **statistically proven structural patterns.**\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Centrality Analysis (The \"Role Players\")\n",

        "Centrality metrics quantify the importance or influence of each node based on its position in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Centrality Metric | Function Used | Strategic Interpretation |\n",
        "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
        "| **Degree** | **`find_hub_products`** | **Popularity:** Measures direct connections. Hub Products are universally popular or required items. |\n",
        "| **Betweenness** | **`find_bridge_customers`** | **Influence/Control:** Measures how often a node lies on the shortest path between others. Bridge Customers connect otherwise separate groups, making them highly influential to market flow. |\n",
        "| **Combined** | **`find_influencer_products`** | Products that are both popular (High Degree) and connective (High Betweenness) are the true **market drivers**. |\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✨ Differentiation: Market Gap Discovery\n",
        "\n",
        "This module is perfectly engineered to find \"ghost demand\" and structural weaknesses:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Isolated Products (`find_isolated_products`):** This function explicitly identifies products that are failing to integrate into the customer or product ecosystem. This is a direct signal of a **product-market fit failure** or an overlooked marketing channel.\n",
        "* **Bottleneck Detection:** Customers with high Betweenness Centrality (Bridge Customers) represent key strategic marketing targets. Losing them breaks communication pathways, while leveraging them unlocks new market segments.\n",
        "* **Rigorous Evidence:** By providing both **structural evidence (motifs)** and **role evidence (centrality)**, your agent gives the Synthesis Agent a complete, multi-layered view of the market, which is essential for developing complex strategy."
