        "Most companies have:\n",
        "- Point AI tools that automate individual tasks\n",
        "- No coordination between AI systems\n",
        "- No clear ROI or business impact\n",
        "- Unpredictable results and limited visibility\n",
        "- Difficulty scaling AI across departments\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Problem: \"We have AI tools, but we don't know if they're moving the needle on business goals.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: The orchestrator aligns all AI actions to measurable business missions:\n",
        "- \"Reduce customer onboarding time by 40%\"\n",
        "- \"Accelerate sales pipeline progression\"\n",
        "- \"Improve support resolution time\"\n",
