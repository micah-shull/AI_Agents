        "The **Experimentation Portfolio Orchestrator** is an AI system that manages the full lifecycle of experiments across an organization.\n",
        "Instead of manually designing A/B tests, tracking results, or debating what to scale, this orchestrator acts as the **central intelligence layer** that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* designs experiments\n",
        "* generates hypotheses\n",
        "* sets up control and treatment groups\n",
        "* collects and analyzes metrics\n",
        "* interprets causal impact\n",
        "* recommends next steps (scale, pivot, retire)\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns experimentation from a scattered, manual effort into a **disciplined, automated, organization-wide capability**.\n",

        "\n",
        "Nearly every company struggles with the same problem:\n",
        "They invest in AI, but **cannot prove what works**, **why it works**, or **how to scale it**.\n",
