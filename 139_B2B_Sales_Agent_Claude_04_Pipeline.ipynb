        "The way you‚Äôve structured things (with `research_agent.py`, `analysis_agent.py`, `personalization_agent.py`, and then `sales_orchestrator.py` pulling them together) **is very much best practice** in Python projects .\n",
        "\n",
        "Here‚Äôs why this separation into individual `.py` files (modules) is the clean approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## üîπ Why separate agents into their own `.py` files?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n",
        "   Each agent has one purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * `research_agent.py` ‚Üí gather company info.\n",
        "   * `analysis_agent.py` ‚Üí analyze pain points/opportunities.\n",
        "   * `personalization_agent.py` ‚Üí generate outreach.\n",
        "     Keeping each in its own file avoids bloated ‚Äúgod classes‚Äù and keeps logic focused.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability**\n",
        "   If you wanted to reuse the `AnalysisAgent` in another project (say, not sales, but market analysis), you can import it without dragging in the whole sales pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Testability**\n",
        "   You can unit test each agent in isolation. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   pytest tests/test_analysis_agent.py\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Much easier than testing a giant single file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scalability**\n",
        "   As your system grows (more agents, more steps), adding a new file is cleaner than stuffing everything into one mega-module.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Orchestrator stays lean**\n",
        "   In `sales_orchestrator.py`, you just import the agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from research_agent import ResearchAgent, CompanyInfo\n",
        "   from analysis_agent import AnalysisAgent, AnalysisResult\n",
        "   from personalization_agent import PersonalizationAgent, PersonalizationResult\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This makes the orchestrator focus only on *workflow*, not agent internals .\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## üîπ Where to store data/config (like industry patterns)\n",
        "\n",
        "For static knowledge like your `_industry_patterns`, best practice is:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Keep **logic in `.py` files**.\n",
        "* Keep **data/config in JSON/YAML** files.\n",
        "\n",
        "That way:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Agents remain small, logic-focused modules.\n",
        "* Updating patterns is a *data-editing* task, not a *code-editing* task.\n",
        "* Orchestrator/agents just `load` what they need.\n",
