        "- Problem: Showing `$76.14` instead of `76.14%`\n",
        "- Solution: Reordered formatting logic to check for percentages before currency\n",
        "- Result: Now correctly displays as `76.14%` (handles both decimal 0-1 and percentage 0-100 formats)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Added \"Statistical Readiness\" section\n",
        "- New section appears when no historical data is available\n",
        "- Shows:\n",
        "  - Requirements for statistical testing (3+ historical runs)\n",
        "  - Estimated time to statistical confidence\n",
        "  - Clear path forward for executives\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Improved language around directional metrics\n",
        "- Changed: \"No statistically significant changes detected (or insufficient historical data)\"\n",
        "- To: \"No statistically significant changes detected. This analysis currently reflects directional metrics only.\"\n",
        "- Why: Uses recognized executive terminology and separates \"no change\" from \"no data\"\n",
