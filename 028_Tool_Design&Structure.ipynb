        "\n",
        "In this lecture, we learned that **tool descriptions** are essential for agents to understand and apply tools effectively. Instead of relying on vague commands, agents need clear, structured information about the tools they will use. Here are the core concepts we need to grasp:\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Agents cannot perform tasks** unless they understand the **tools** at their disposal.\n",
        "* Each tool must be **described with clear metadata** that specifies:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Tool name**: What does the tool do?\n",
        "  * **Arguments (inputs)**: What does the tool require in order to function?\n",
        "  * **Outputs**: What results or changes can we expect after the tool runs?\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Tool Descriptions Enable Clear Interfacing**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **JSON Schema** is a structured way of defining tool properties (inputs, outputs, constraints).\n",

        "  * **Inputs** can be basic data types (e.g., strings, numbers) or more complex (e.g., arrays, enums).\n",
        "  * **Outputs** can be validated for consistency and expected results.\n",
