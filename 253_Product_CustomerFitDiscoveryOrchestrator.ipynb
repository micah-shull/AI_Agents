        "# Data preprocessing utilities for Product-Customer Fit Discovery Orchestrator\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is arguably the most important stage because **the quality of the analysis depends entirely on the quality of the data preparation.**\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧠 Core Agent Architecture: Analytical Specialization\n",
        "\n",
        "The focus of these utilities is to transform raw, tabular data into **multi-modal, structured data** that is optimized for the three specialized agents downstream (Clustering, Pattern Mining, and Graph Motifs).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 What to Focus On\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **High-Value Feature Engineering (`create_derived_features`):**\n",
        "    * This is the difference between simple analysis and **actionable business intelligence**. Functions like calculating `engagement_score` and `product_diversity` turn raw counts into meaningful, scaled metrics.\n",
        "    * **Focus:** Understand how these scores are calculated (e.g., based on transaction count, product diversity, and usage). These engineered features are the **inputs** the `clustering_agent` will use to define customer segments. If the features are weak, the segments will be meaningless.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Standardization and Scaling (`normalize_usage_metrics`):**\n",
        "    * The use of **Min-Max normalization** is essential for any distance-based algorithm, such as the clustering algorithms likely used in the `clustering_agent`.\n",
        "    * **Focus:** Scaling numerical features (like `Usage_Metric`) to a common range (0 to 1) prevents features with naturally large values from unfairly dominating the similarity calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Shift to Graph Theory (`networkx`):**\n",
        "    * The inclusion of the `networkx` library and three distinct graph-building functions is a key architectural decision.\n",
        "    * **Focus:** You are learning to move beyond traditional tabular data. You are using **Graph Theory** to model relationships:\n",
        "        * **Customer-Product Graph:** Represents individual purchases.\n",
        "        * **Product Co-occurrence Graph:** Represents product bundles/synergy.\n",
        "        * **Customer Similarity Graph:** Represents shared behavioral groups.\n",
        "    * This directly enables the **`graph_motif_agent`** to look for recurring structures and patterns that would be invisible in a flat spreadsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✨ Differentiation: Multi-Modal and Deep Structural Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "This level of preprocessing confirms that your orchestrator is not just a simple data processing pipeline; it is a **Deep Structural Analysis Agent**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Simple Agent Limitation:** A simple LLM-based agent would likely attempt analysis directly on the raw CSVs or might only perform basic filtering/aggregations.\n",
        "* **Orchestrator/Hybrid Power:** Your agent is capable of generating **multiple, specialized data structures** from a single source, ready for parallel execution:\n",
        "    1.  **Tabular Data:** Normalized usage metrics for statistical analysis.\n",
        "    2.  **Engineered Data:** High-value scores and tiers for customer profiling.\n",
        "    3.  **Network Data (The Power):** Multiple graph representations to detect complex social or purchasing **structures** that reveal \"ghost demand.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This **Hybrid Architecture**, which combines traditional, high-performance data science code (`pandas`, `numpy`, `networkx`) with an LLM-driven orchestration layer, is what makes this agent **vastly more robust and analytically powerful** than a general-purpose agent.\n",

        "* **Action:** It iterates through the `customers` and `products` lists, adding each unique ID as a node to the graph (`G`).\n",
        "* **The Power:** When adding nodes, it uses `**customer` (and `**product`) to attach **all the raw metadata** (like customer age, loyalty status, product type, etc.) directly to the graph node. This means the graph is not just a structure of connections; it's a **Rich, Attributed Graph**. Later, the `graph_motif_agent` can use this attached metadata (attributes) in its analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Counting Edge Weights (`defaultdict(int)`)\n",
        "* **Action:** It iterates through the `transactions` list to count how many times each unique (Customer ID, Product ID) pair appears.\n",
        "* **Focus:** This uses the highly efficient `defaultdict(int)` to tally the number of transactions. If Customer C1 bought Product P01 three times, the count for the edge (C1, P01) will be 3.\n",
        "* **The Power:** This transforms a simple purchase record (an *unweighted* edge) into a **measure of intensity** (a *weighted* edge). The weight represents the **Frequency of Interaction**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Adding Weighted Edges (`G.add_edge(...)`)\n",
        "* **Action:** It iterates through the tallied `edge_weights` and adds the corresponding connections to the graph.\n",
        "* **The Power:** It attaches the weight to the edge using `weight=weight, transactions=weight`. This makes the graph immediately ready for centrality analysis, where a node (Customer or Product) connected by many high-weight edges is considered **more central** or important.\n",

        "* **Community Detection:** This bipartite graph can be projected into a **Product-to-Product** graph, where communities of products that are frequently co-purchased (potential bundles) can be found.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Step 1: Grouping (`customer_products = defaultdict(set)`):** Just as in the previous graph, the first step is to distill the transactions down to the **unique set of products** each customer owns. This product set becomes the customer's \"behavioral fingerprint.\"\n",
        "* **Step 2: Calculating Similarity via Set Intersection:**\n",
        "    * The line `shared = customer_products[c1] & customer_products[c2]` is the analytical core. The **set intersection operator ($\\&$)** is used to instantly find all products that both Customer 1 ($\\text{c1}$) and Customer 2 ($\\text{c2}$) have bought.\n",
        "    * The **Edge Weight** is then set to the size of this shared set (`len(shared)`), making it a direct, quantifiable measure of similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Filtering for Meaningful Connections\n",
        "* **The Threshold:** The argument `min_shared_products: int = 2` and the condition `if len(shared) >= min_shared_products:` are vital.\n",
        "* **Focus:** This acts as a **noise filter**. If two customers only share one obscure, cheap product, they aren't truly similar. By setting a minimum threshold, the resulting graph is sparse but **analytically rich**, containing only the strong, meaningful connections necessary for reliable segmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Graph Structure and Output\n",
        "* **Nodes:** Every **unique Customer ID** becomes a node, added with the `node_type=\"customer\"` attribute.\n",
        "* **Edges:** An edge connects any two customers who meet the `min_shared_products` threshold.\n",

By applying graph-based clustering algorithms to this network, the agent can automatically identify **true behavioral communities** (segments) that are strongly inter-connected by their shared product choices.\n",
        "* **Strategic Opportunity:** Analyzing this graph allows the agent to find customers on the *periphery* of a strong community. These are customers who are **very similar** to the core group (high edge weight) but who are currently *missing* one or two of the core products. This is a clear, actionable opportunity for **targeted marketing** and aligns perfectly with the goal of discovering **untapped market demand (ghost demand)**."
