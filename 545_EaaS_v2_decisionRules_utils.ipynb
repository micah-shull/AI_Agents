        "\n",
        "This module defines the **decision spine** of the orchestrator.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical business terms, it answers three critical questions for every customer interaction:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What kind of problem is this?**\n",
        "2. **What sequence of actions should we take?**\n",
        "3. **What outcome are we trying to achieve?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Those questions are answered using **explicit, inspectable rules**, not probabilistic guesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly the layer where most AI systems become opaque — and you’ve intentionally made it the opposite.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Matters Operationally\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision logic is where AI systems typically:\n",
        "\n",
        "* become difficult to explain\n",
        "* embed bias unintentionally\n",
        "* drift over time\n",
        "* break trust with stakeholders\n",
        "\n",
        "By isolating decision rules into:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `classify_issue`\n",
        "* `determine_resolution_path`\n",
        "* `determine_expected_outcome`\n",
        "\n",
        "you ensure that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* logic is testable\n",
        "* behavior is predictable\n",
        "* changes are intentional\n",
        "* regressions are detectable\n",
        "\n",

        "## Why Leaders Would Be Relieved to See This\n",
        "\n",
        "From a CEO or business manager’s point of view, this module answers a deeply uncomfortable question they often have about AI systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *“Can anyone actually explain why the system did what it did?”*\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the answer is clearly **yes**.\n",
        "\n",
        "A leader can literally read:\n",

        "* how churn risk affects treatment\n",
        "* why certain issues escalate\n",
        "* when refunds are triggered\n",
        "* how loyalty and engagement influence tone and response\n",
        "\n",
        "There’s no black box. No “the model decided.”\n",
        "\n",
        "That transparency dramatically lowers perceived risk.\n",

        "## Key Design Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Business-Readable Rules (Not Model Guessing)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your classification logic uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "* logistics status\n",
        "* churn risk thresholds\n",
        "* order flags\n",
        "* known issue categories\n",
        "\n",
        "These are **business signals**, not abstract embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "That means:\n",
        "\n",
        "* rules can be reviewed by non-engineers\n",
        "* thresholds can be debated and tuned\n",
        "* policy changes don’t require retraining models\n",
        "\n",
        "Most production agents hide this logic inside prompts or classifiers. You’ve surfaced it explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Churn Risk as a First-Class Decision Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "This is especially strong.\n",
        "\n",
        "By branching behavior on `customer.churn_risk`, you’ve encoded a key business reality:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Not all customers should be treated the same.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Executives immediately recognize this logic because it mirrors how human teams operate:\n",
        "\n",
        "* high-risk customers get more care\n",
        "* repeat issues escalate faster\n",
        "* loyalty and engagement matter\n",
        "\n",
        "Seeing this logic explicit — rather than implied — is deeply reassuring.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Separation Between Classification, Action, and Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "You deliberately separated:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **what the issue is**\n",
        "* **what we do**\n",
        "* **what success looks like**\n",
        "\n",
        "That separation is rare — and powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables:\n",
        "\n",
        "* independent testing of each step\n",
        "* clear failure attribution\n",
        "* alternative strategies without rewriting everything\n",
        "\n",
        "Most agents collapse these into a single reasoning step. You’ve turned them into composable building blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Deterministic Resolution Paths\n",
        "\n",
        "The `determine_resolution_path` function is especially important from a governance perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "It means:\n",
        "\n",
        "* every issue type has a known playbook\n",
        "* escalation paths are predictable\n",
        "* ordering is explicit\n",
        "* nothing “creative” happens at runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly how enterprise workflows are designed — and exactly how executives expect AI to behave when it touches customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. MVP-Honest Ticket Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Your `extract_ticket_from_message` function is refreshingly honest.\n",
        "\n",
        "You explicitly state:\n",
        "\n",
        "* for MVP, use known labels\n",
        "* NLP comes later\n",
        "* fallbacks are deterministic\n",

        "\n",
        "Most AI agents today:\n",
        "\n",
        "* classify issues implicitly inside prompts\n",
        "* determine actions dynamically via LLM reasoning\n",
        "* cannot explain escalation logic\n",

        "* externalizes decision logic\n",

        "* allows policy changes without model changes\n",
        "* treats LLMs (later) as helpers, not judges\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s a fundamental architectural difference.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Why This Design Supports ROI and Accountability\n",
        "\n",
        "Because decisions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* deterministic\n",
        "* testable\n",
        "* traceable\n",
        "* historically comparable\n",

        "\n",
        "What leaders would see here is not “business logic in code.”\n",
