        "\n",
        "- Use regex patterns for common PII types (email, phone, SSN)\n",

        "- Focus on: node execution, state management, graph wiring, error handling\n",

        "### Phase 2: Incremental Improvements\n",
        "**Goal:** Improve detection accuracy and add features\n",
        "\n",
        "**Order:**\n",
        "1. **Enhanced PII detection** → Add more PII types, better patterns\n",
        "2. **LLM validation** → Context-aware detection for edge cases\n",
        "3. **Risk scoring** → More sophisticated risk calculation\n",
        "4. **Multi-format support** → Better parsing for logs, databases, APIs\n",
        "5. **Additional frameworks** → HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.\n",

        "## Technical Decisions\n",

        "- **Choice:** Python standard library (csv, json) + pandas for CSV\n",
        "- **Rationale:** Simple, reliable, no external dependencies for MVP\n",
        "- **Future:** Add support for Excel, Parquet, database connections\n",
        "\n",
        "### PII Detection Strategy\n",
        "- **MVP:** Regex patterns + basic validation\n",
        "- **Hybrid approach:** Pattern matching for speed, LLM for ambiguous cases\n",
        "- **Rationale:** Fast detection with high accuracy for common patterns\n",
        "- **Future:** ML-based detection, named entity recognition\n",
        "\n",

        "- **MVP:** Fixed GDPR rules (hardcoded)\n",
        "- **Rationale:** Get compliance logic working, then make it configurable\n",
        "- **Future:** Configurable frameworks, web search for latest rules\n",
        "\n",
        "### Risk Scoring\n",
        "- **MVP:** Deterministic algorithm based on:\n",
        "  - Number of PII fields detected\n",
        "  - Type of PII (sensitivity levels)\n",
        "  - Data volume\n",

        "- Keep state flat when possible\n",
        "- Document field purpose with comments\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error Handling\n",
        "- **File not found:** Fail immediately (can't proceed without input)\n",
        "- **Parse errors:** Fail gracefully, log error, continue with partial data\n",
        "- **LLM API failures:** Retry once, then fail gracefully\n",
        "- **Template failures:** Fail immediately (can't produce output)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing Strategy\n",
        "- **Smoke test first:** Manual node execution before LangGraph wiring\n",
        "- **Unit tests:** PII detection patterns, file parsers, risk scorers\n",
        "- **Integration tests:** Full workflow with sample test files\n",
