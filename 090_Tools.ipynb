        "* **Reduced ambiguity.** It doesn’t have to infer parameter names or types from prose; they’re always in the same slots.\n",

        "* **Add short examples.** After each schema, include a 1-line example call in the system prompt inside an \\`\\`\\`action block. This dramatically improves correctness.\n",
        "* **Name tools clearly.** Verb-first, specific names (`read_file`, `write_doc_file`) beat vague ones (`process`, `run`).\n",
        "* **Validate on your side.** Even with schemas, keep your tiny validator; if the model hallucinates an arg, you’ll catch it and feed back an `error` action.\n",
