        "## 🔧 Suggested Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Actually call `check_profile_against_standards()`\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, you wrote the function but didn’t wire it into `lead_source_agent_linkedin`. Add it after the required fields check:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "    standards_check = check_profile_against_standards(profile)\n",
        "    if standards_check:\n",
        "        return standards_check\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures the new filter actually runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Pass `icp_config` into the standards check\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, your standards are hardcoded (roles, departments).\n",
        "Better: use values from `icp_config` if provided:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def check_profile_against_standards(profile: dict, icp_config: dict | None = None) -> dict | None:\n",
        "    senior_roles = icp_config.get(\"roles\", [\"Head\", \"Director\", \"VP\", \"Chief\", \"C-level\", \"Founder\"])\n",
        "    relevant_departments = icp_config.get(\"departments\", [\"Technology\", \"Engineering\", \"Finance\", \"Executive\"])\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes it reusable for different ICPs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Return structure consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "Some checks return `{\"qualified\": False, \"reason\": ..., \"lead\": profile}` while the final return adds `\"confidence\"`.\n",
        "For consistency, you might want *all* returns to include the same keys (`qualified, reason, lead, confidence`) even if `confidence=None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Logging / traceability\n",
        "\n",
        "It will help later to log *which check failed*. You could add a `\"stage\"` key:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "return {\"qualified\": False, \"reason\": \"Duplicate lead\", \"stage\": \"duplicate_check\", \"lead\": profile}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "That way you know where the pipeline filtered someone out.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Extend Goal Agent for programmatic use\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, `goal_agent()` only returns strings. Later, you might want structured outputs so each agent can “subscribe” to its sub-goal:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "\"sub_goals\": {\n",
        "    \"lead_source\": \"Identify potential leads\",\n",
        "    \"enrichment\": \"Enrich lead with context\",\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This lets you align agents programmatically to their sub-goal.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Suggested Next Step\n",
        "\n",
        "I’d recommend **wiring in the standards check** and making it ICP-aware (suggestions 1 + 2). That’ll make the pipeline feel more complete and configurable.\n",
