        "- **Continues** thinking if needed\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Key LangChain Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Automatic Reasoning (ReAct Pattern)**\n",
        "Your agent follows the **ReAct** pattern: **Reasoning** → **Acting** → **Observing**\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice in your output:\n",

        "Action: calculator          ← Agent decided what to do\n",

        "\n",
        "The LLM automatically figured out it needed math, chose the calculator, and formatted everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Tool Abstraction**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "tools = [Tool(name=\"calculator\", func=calculator, description=\"...\")]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain standardizes how tools work. You just define:\n",
        "- **What** it does (function)\n",
        "- **When** to use it (description)\n",
        "- **What** to call it (name)\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent reads descriptions and picks tools automatically!\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Prompt Engineering Built-In**\n",
        "That `hub.pull(\"hwchase17/react\")` prompt contains sophisticated instructions like:\n",
        "- How to format tool calls\n",
        "- When to stop thinking\n",
        "- How to handle errors\n",
        "- Multi-step reasoning patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "You get years of prompt engineering research for free.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Error Handling & Parsing**\n",
        "LangChain handles:\n",
        "- Malformed tool calls\n",
        "- Parsing LLM responses\n",
        "- Tool execution errors\n",
        "- Infinite loops (max_iterations)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Choose LangChain Over Raw Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scalability**: Add new tools easily - just append to the list\n",
        "**Flexibility**: The same agent works with any LLM (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)\n",
        "**Reliability**: Built-in error handling and retry logic\n",
        "**Composability**: Chain multiple agents together\n",
        "**Community**: Thousands of pre-built tools and integrations\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Makes Your Agent \"Smart\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Your agent isn't just following if/else statements. It's:\n",
        "1. **Reading** your question\n",
        "2. **Understanding** it needs math\n",
        "3. **Choosing** the calculator tool\n",
        "4. **Executing** the tool correctly\n",
        "5. **Interpreting** the result\n",
        "6. **Responding** naturally\n",
        "\n",
        "Try asking it: *\"What's 10 * 5 and also tell me what you think about pizza\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "It should use the calculator for math but answer the pizza question directly without tools!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Want to see the magic?** Try these questions:\n",
        "- \"What's 100 divided by 4?\"\n",
        "- \"Tell me a joke\" (no tools needed)\n",
        "- \"What's 2+2 and what's the capital of France?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Each response will show you how the agent *thinks* and *decides* what to do. That's the LangChain advantage - intelligent, automatic decision-making rather than hardcoded logic!"
