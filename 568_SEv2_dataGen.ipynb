        "# MVP2 Data Suggestions — Sales Enablement Orchestrator\n",
        "\n",
        "This document suggests **additional and enhanced data** for your Sales Enablement Orchestrator MVP2. The goal is to make the agent more realistic and architecturally interesting **without** growing the dataset so much that it distracts from learning orchestration.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You Already Have (MVP1)\n",
        "\n",
        "| Dataset | Records | Purpose |\n",
        "|---------|---------|---------|\n",
        "| **leads.json** | 20 | Prioritization, personalization, objection/needs inference |\n",
        "| **sales_reps.json** | 4 | Nudging, load balancing, performance context |\n",
        "| **interactions.json** | 12 | Follow-up orchestration, objection/sentiment hooks |\n",
        "| **deals.json** | 15 | Forecasting, risk, executive reporting |\n",
        "| **signals.json** | 20 | Orchestrator “brain fuel,” recommended actions, urgency |\n",
        "\n",
        "Your schemas are solid and aligned with the agent_data_gen_plan. The main MVP2 opportunities are: **(1) a few small reference tables**, **(2) linking and consistency**, and **(3) one config file** so the orchestrator’s logic stays explicit and demo-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Suggested Additions (by impact vs effort)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **content_assets.json** (NEW — high value, low effort)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** The orchestrator recommends “send pricing comparison,” “send case study,” “implementation doc.” Giving it a tiny catalog of assets makes those recommendations **concrete** and testable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested schema (5–10 rows):**\n",
        "\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"asset_id\": \"A-001\",\n",
        "  \"name\": \"Pricing comparison one-pager\",\n",
        "  \"type\": \"one_pager\",\n",
        "  \"use_cases\": [\"pricing pushback\", \"competitor comparison\"],\n",
        "  \"stage_fit\": [\"Qualification\", \"Proposal\", \"Negotiation\"]\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fields:** `asset_id`, `name`, `type` (one_pager, case_study, demo_video, implementation_guide, security_doc), `use_cases`, `stage_fit`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Volume:** 5–10 assets. Keep names and use_cases aligned with the `recommended_action` and `key_topics` you already use in signals/interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** Map `signals.recommended_action` or interaction `key_topics` → `content_assets`; e.g. “send pricing comparison” → filter assets where `use_cases` includes “pricing pushback.”\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **objections.json** (NEW — high value, low effort)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** The intro doc stresses **objection detection** and tailoring messaging. A small reference table turns “objection → recommended response” into deterministic, demo-ready logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested schema (≈10 rows):**\n",
        "\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"objection_id\": \"OBJ-001\",\n",
        "  \"label\": \"Pricing too high\",\n",
        "  \"theme\": \"pricing\",\n",
        "  \"suggested_asset_types\": [\"one_pager\", \"case_study\"],\n",
        "  \"suggested_actions\": [\"send pricing justification\", \"send ROI case study\"]\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Volume:** 8–12 objections. Themes could match your existing `key_topics` and `risk_flags` (e.g. pricing, timeline, budget, competition, security).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** From `interactions.key_topics` or `deals.risk_flags`, map to `objections` → get `suggested_asset_types` / `suggested_actions` for next-step logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **deal_id on interactions** (ENHANCE existing)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** Today interactions point to `lead_id` and `rep_id` but not to a specific deal. Many leads have 1:1 lead→deal, but the mental model is “this touch happened in the context of this deal.” Adding optional `deal_id` makes “last activity per deal” and “deal timeline” natural without changing record count.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Change:** Add optional `\"deal_id\": \"D-001\"` to each interaction row where that interaction clearly belongs to a deal. Leave it null or omitted for early-stage touches before a deal exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** “Stalled deal” = deal with `days_in_stage` high and no recent interaction linked via `deal_id` (or lead_id + time window).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **stage_actions.json** (NEW — medium value, low effort)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** “What should we do next for this deal?” is a core orchestrator question. A small playbook of stage → suggested actions gives the agent a clear, configurable rule set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested schema (one row per stage, or per stage + scenario):**\n",
        "\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"stage\": \"Proposal\",\n",
        "  \"default_next_actions\": [\"follow up on proposal\", \"share case study\", \"offer exec briefing\"],\n",
        "  \"if_stalled_days\": 14,\n",
        "  \"stalled_actions\": [\"escalate to manager\", \"send re-engagement sequence\"]\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Volume:** 6–8 rows (Discovery, Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, plus optional Closed Won/Lost for handoff messaging).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** Given `deal.stage` and `deal.days_in_stage`, choose from `default_next_actions` or `stalled_actions` and combine with `content_assets` / `objections` when relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **thresholds.json or config.json** (NEW — high value, minimal effort)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** The plan calls out “CEO-style insights” and “decision thresholds.” A single small config file makes “what counts as stalled?” or “what counts as high-intent?” explicit and editable, which is great for demos and for learning orchestration logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested content (example):**\n",
        "\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"stalled_deal_days_in_stage\": 21,\n",
        "  \"high_priority_intent_min\": 0.80,\n",
        "  \"at_risk_engagement_max\": 0.50,\n",
        "  \"urgent_deal_days_to_close_max\": 14\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** Use these values when ranking leads, flagging at-risk deals, and deciding urgency. Keeps logic out of code and in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **More interactions for a few key deals** (ENHANCE existing)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** You have 12 interactions across 20 leads; several deals (e.g. in Proposal/Negotiation) have no or one interaction. Adding **5–8** more interactions—especially for 2–3 deals that are “hot” or “stalled”—makes follow-up and “next step” logic feel real.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Targets:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1–2 deals in Proposal/Negotiation with 2–3 touches each (e.g. proposal sent → follow-up call → pricing question).\n",
        "- 1 deal that looks “stalled” (long `days_in_stage`, no recent touch).\n",
        "- Optionally 1–2 early-stage leads (Discovery/Qualification) with a single call or email.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** Richer “last contact” and “next step promised” behavior; more realistic nudge triggers.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **competitors.json** (NEW — optional, very small)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why:** Deals already have `competitors` (e.g. \"VendorX\", \"VendorY\"). A tiny reference table (3–5 rows) with “win theme” or “weakness” gives the orchestrator something to say when it recommends competitive battlecards or positioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested schema:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{\n",
        "  \"competitor_id\": \"VendorX\",\n",
        "  \"display_name\": \"Vendor X\",\n",
        "  \"common_weakness\": \"Implementation timeline\",\n",
        "  \"win_theme\": \"Ease of deployment\"\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Volume:** 3–5, matching the competitor strings you use in `deals.json`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator use:** When `deal.competitors` is non-empty, look up `competitors` and suggest “highlight ease of deployment” or “share implementation comparison” type actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Consistency and coverage (no new files)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Leads with deals but no interactions:**  \n",
        "Consider giving every lead that has a deal at least one interaction (even a short email or call). That avoids “deal exists but we have no history” in demos.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Signals ↔ deals:**  \n",
        "Where a lead has a deal, ensure `signals.recommended_action` and `signals.urgency` are plausible for that deal’s `stage` and `risk_flags`. You don’t need to change schema—just a quick consistency pass so the orchestrator’s decisions look coherent.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What to Skip for MVP2 (keep focus on architecture)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Heavy CRM-style history:** Many more interactions or full email threads. Better to learn orchestration with the above additions than to maintain large timelines.\n",
        "- **Full product catalog or pricing matrix:** A few content assets are enough; detailed product/SKU data can wait.\n",
        "- **Territory/assignment rules:** Your existing `region` on leads and reps is enough for “assign by region” logic; a separate territories table doesn’t pay off yet.\n",
        "- **User/tenant multi-tenancy:** Out of scope for MVP2.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Recommended MVP2 build order\n",
        "\n",
        "| Order | Item | Effort | Effect |\n",
        "|-------|------|--------|--------|\n",
        "| 1 | **thresholds.json** (or config) | ~5 min | Makes orchestration logic configurable and visible |\n",
        "| 2 | **objections.json** | ~15 min | Connects topics/risk_flags → actions and assets |\n",
        "| 3 | **content_assets.json** | ~15 min | Turns “send X” into concrete asset picks |\n",
        "| 4 | **deal_id** on existing interactions | ~10 min | Enables deal-level timeline and stall detection |\n",
        "| 5 | **stage_actions.json** | ~15 min | Stage-based “what to do next” playbook |\n",
        "| 6 | **5–8 more interactions** | ~20 min | Richer follow-up and nudge behavior |\n",
        "| 7 | **competitors.json** (optional) | ~5 min | Nice for competitive-deal recommendations |\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "MVP2 stays small: **three small reference files** (content_assets, objections, stage_actions), **one config file** (thresholds), **optional competitors**, plus **linking (deal_id)** and **a few more interactions**. That’s enough to make prioritization, personalization, follow-up, and “what to do next” feel realistic while you focus on how the orchestrator composes agents and uses these tables—rather than on curating large datasets.\n",
