        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "This notebook extends our existing Feedback Intelligence Agent by introducing **sentiment analysis** to better understand the emotional tone behind employee feedback at Target.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Goal\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify and track how employees feel about their work environment — not just what they say, but **how they say it**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ What This Agent Will Do\n",
        "\n",
        "* Analyze employee feedback text for **sentiment** (Positive / Neutral / Negative)\n",
        "* Combine this sentiment data with existing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Department (e.g., GM, OOF)\n",
        "  * Topic (e.g., scanner issues, cart availability)\n",
        "  * Summary (from our previous agent)\n",
        "* Surface:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Which departments show more frustration or positivity\n",
        "  * Which topics are emotionally charged\n",
        "  * Trends or pain points worth investigating further\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Negative feedback** often signals operational friction, burnout, or poor training\n",
        "* **Positive sentiment** can highlight what’s working — and where leadership is succeeding\n",
        "* **Neutral feedback** often reflects informative but unemotional reporting\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding **tone + topic together** gives store managers a more complete, empathetic view of the employee experience.\n",
