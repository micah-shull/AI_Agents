        "This module is responsible for **quantifying how exposed work is to automation** and translating that exposure into **actionable, explainable insights**. It is one of the most critical components of the orchestrator because it directly informs reskilling priorities, role evolution decisions, and executive risk conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, this entire layer is **rules-based and transparent**. No LLMs are involved. Every decision can be inspected, adjusted, and justified.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `categorize_task_by_risk` function classifies tasks as **low, medium, or high automation risk** using thresholds defined in configuration.\n",
        "\n",

        "* Leadership can change what “high risk” means\n",

        "The `analyze_role_automation_risk` function evaluates automation exposure at the **role level**, not just the task level.\n",

        "### 📊 Aggregates Task Risk\n",
        "\n",
        "Tasks are grouped into:\n",

        "* High-risk\n",
        "* Medium-risk\n",

        "\n",
        "### ⚖️ Computes an Overall Risk Score\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than cherry-picking worst cases, the function calculates a **weighted average risk score** across all tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This avoids alarmism and supports balanced decision-making:\n",

        "\n",
        "The `analyze_employee_automation_risk` function does something subtle and very smart:\n",
        "\n",
        "It **reuses role-level analysis** rather than inventing a new employee-specific model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures:\n",

        "* Consistency between role and employee narratives\n",
        "* No conflicting conclusions\n",
        "* Simpler reasoning paths\n",

        "* Apply the same core logic everywhere\n",
        "* Produce uniform analysis artifacts\n",

        "\n",
        "* Comparable across roles\n",
        "* Aggregatable for dashboards\n",
