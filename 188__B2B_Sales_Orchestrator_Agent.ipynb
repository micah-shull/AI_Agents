        "\n",
        "### Challenge 1: Extracting Structured Data from Web Search\n",
        "**Problem:** Web search returns unstructured text, need to extract structured company profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Use LLM to extract structured data from search results\n",
        "- Define clear extraction schema (company profile, pain points, buying signals)\n",
        "- Use Pydantic schemas for validation\n",
        "- Retry logic if extraction fails\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge 2: Generating Personalized Messages\n",
        "**Problem:** Need truly personalized messages, not generic templates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Use LLM with company research context\n",
        "- Include specific pain points and buying signals in prompt\n",
        "- Generate company-specific hooks (reference recent news, funding)\n",
        "- Validate personalization (check for company name, specific references)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge 3: Mock Decision-Maker Data\n",
        "**Problem:** Need realistic but clearly synthetic decision-makers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution (MVP):**\n",
        "- Use **fixed template** (not LLM-generated)\n",
        "- Template: [\"VP of Sales\", \"Director of Operations\", \"VP of Engineering\"]\n",
        "- Generate 1-3 decision-makers using template\n",
        "- Mark clearly as \"PLACEHOLDER\" in output\n",
        "- **Phase 2:** Replace with LLM-generated or real APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge 4: ICP Fit Scoring\n",
        "**Problem:** Need objective fit scoring criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Define clear ICP criteria upfront\n",
        "- Use deterministic scoring algorithm\n",
        "- Make criteria configurable (via goal or config)\n",
        "- Document scoring rationale in report\n",

        "- ✅ Successfully researches real companies using web search\n",
        "- ✅ Extracts structured company profile, pain points, buying signals\n",
        "- ✅ Calculates ICP fit score\n",
        "- ✅ Generates personalized outreach messages\n",

        "- ✅ Handles API failures gracefully (continues with partial data)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quality Gates\n",
        "- Smoke test passes (all nodes execute in sequence)\n",
        "- Unit tests pass (web search, research parser, fit scorer)\n",
        "- Integration test passes (full workflow with real company)\n",
        "- Reports render correctly from templates\n",
        "- Personalization validated (messages contain company-specific elements)\n",
        "- Error handling works for common failure modes\n",

        "1. **Conditional Routing:** Route based on fit score (high fit → proposal, low fit → nurture)\n",
        "2. **Batch Processing:** Support CSV input with multiple companies\n",
        "3. **Real Contact Enrichment:** Integrate Apollo, Clearbit, or Clay APIs\n",
        "4. **Response Handling:** Analyze email/LinkedIn responses and route accordingly\n",
        "5. **CRM Integration:** Sync with HubSpot, Salesforce\n",
        "6. **Follow-up Sequences:** Automated follow-up tracking and sending\n",

        "\n",
        "## Decisions Made ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Format:** ✅ Single company name (Target for MVP testing)\n",
        "2. **Web Search API:** ✅ Tavily (user has API key)\n",
        "3. **Decision-Maker Generation:** ✅ Fixed template (not LLM-generated for MVP)\n",
        "4. **ICP Criteria:** ✅ Fixed defaults (not configurable for MVP)\n",
        "5. **Message Personalization:** ✅ Dummy data initially, replace incrementally\n",

        "**Development Strategy:**\n",
