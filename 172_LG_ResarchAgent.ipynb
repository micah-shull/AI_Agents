        "\n",
        "### **1. Added `goal_interpretation: Dict[str, any]`**\n",
        "**Why this change?**\n",
        "- In the original scaffold, the goal was just passed through as-is\n",
        "- Now we use an LLM to actually **analyze and structure** the goal\n",
        "- This field stores the LLM's interpretation of what the user wants, including:\n",
        "  - Key topics extracted\n",
        "  - Target audience analysis\n",
        "  - Success criteria breakdown\n",
        "  - Suggested search approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it enables:**\n",
        "- More intelligent search strategy generation\n",
        "- Better report tailoring to the actual goal\n",
        "- Smarter validation against original intent\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Changed `search_results: List[Dict]` → `Dict[str, List[Dict]]`**\n",
        "**Why this change?**\n",
        "- Original: All search results were lumped together in one list\n",
        "- New: Results are organized **by search query**\n",
        "- This matches how real web search works - you get results per query\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it enables:**\n",
        "- Track which results came from which search queries\n",
        "- Better relevance analysis per query\n",
        "- Debugging and optimization of search strategies\n",
        "- Parallel search execution (each query gets its own result set)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Added `validation_result: Dict[str, any]`**\n",
        "**Why this change?**\n",
        "- Original: Simple boolean check if goal was met\n",
        "- New: Comprehensive validation with detailed feedback\n",
        "- Stores quality scores, completeness metrics, and improvement suggestions\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it enables:**\n",
        "- Detailed quality assessment of the final report\n",
        "- Feedback on what worked well and what didn't\n",
        "- Confidence scoring for the research results\n",
        "- Actionable recommendations for improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why These Changes Matter:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Better Data Flow**: Each stage now has richer data to work with\n",
        "2. **Real Functionality**: Instead of mock data, we're storing actual LLM analysis\n",
        "3. **Debugging**: You can inspect what the LLM actually understood and produced\n",
        "4. **Quality Control**: We can measure and improve the research quality\n",
        "5. **Scalability**: The structure supports more complex research workflows\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that **state management in LangGraph is crucial** - the state schema determines what data flows between nodes, and richer state enables more sophisticated AI workflows.\n",

        "The test is working perfectly! 🎉 I can see the API key issue is resolved and the LLM is successfully interpreting goals and generating search strategies. Let me analyze what we're seeing:\n",
        "\n",
        "## **What's Working Well:**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Goal Interpretation is Working**\n",
        "- ✅ LLM successfully analyzes the research goal\n",
        "- ✅ Extracts key topics: `['artificial intelligence', 'trends', 'industry analysis']`\n",
        "- ✅ Preserves target audience and success criteria\n",
        "- ✅ Generates structured analysis with detailed notes\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Search Strategy Generation is Working**\n",
        "- ✅ LLM creates 6 intelligent search queries\n",
        "- ✅ Queries are relevant to the goal (AI trends, market analysis, etc.)\n",
        "- ✅ Adapts to different research objectives (AI, EVs, cybersecurity)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Adaptive Behavior**\n",
        "- ✅ Different goals produce different query types\n",
        "- ✅ AI trends → \"industry trends\", \"market analysis\"\n",
        "- ✅ EVs → \"competitive landscape\", \"market analysis\"\n",
        "- ✅ Cybersecurity → \"threats\", \"defense strategies\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## **One Small Issue I Notice:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM is generating queries with \"2021\" instead of \"2025\" (current year). This suggests the LLM might be using slightly outdated training data or not considering the current date. This is common and not a major issue, but worth noting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Key Insights from This Test:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The `goal_interpretation` field is working perfectly** - it's storing rich, structured data\n",
        "2. **The LLM is making intelligent decisions** about what queries to generate\n",
        "3. **The two-step process is working** - goal interpretation feeds into search strategy\n",
        "4. **Error handling is in place** - the system gracefully handles different goal types\n",
        "\n",
        "## **What This Demonstrates:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Real AI functionality** instead of mock data\n",
        "- **Intelligent goal understanding**\n",
        "- **Adaptive search query generation**\n",
        "- **Structured data flow** between nodes\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly what we wanted to see! The first two nodes of your research agent are now working with real LLM intelligence instead of placeholder functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ready to move on to the next set of changes?** We can now explain how I updated the web search and data gathering nodes (`execute_parallel_search` and `gather_source_data`) to use real web search functionality instead of mock data.\n",

        "3. Handle different website structures\n",
        "\n",

        "## **✅ What's Working:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **2025 Issue Fixed!** - The LLM is now generating queries with \"2025\" instead of \"2021\"\n",
        "2. **Real DuckDuckGo Scraping** - We're actually hitting DuckDuckGo's servers\n",
        "3. **Proper Error Handling** - When HTML scraping fails, it falls back to instant answer API\n",

        "## **❌ The Issue:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**DuckDuckGo HTML scraping is returning 0 results** - this suggests either:\n",

        "2. They're blocking our requests\n",

        "\n",
        "[2 tools called]\n",
        "\n",
        "Interesting! We're getting a 202 status code (which means \"Accepted\" - DuckDuckGo is processing our request) and only 2 links total. This suggests DuckDuckGo might be using JavaScript to load results dynamically, or they've changed their structure.\n",

        "\n",
        "[1 tool called]\n",
        "\n",
        "Ah! **DuckDuckGo is detecting us as a bot and showing a CAPTCHA!** This is exactly what I mentioned earlier - they're blocking automated requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "The response shows:\n",
        "- \"Unfortunately, bots use DuckDuckGo too.\"\n",
        "- \"Please complete the following challenge to confirm this search was made by a human.\"\n",
        "- \"Select all squares containing a duck:\"\n",

        "## **This is Expected Behavior**\n",
        "\n",
        "DuckDuckGo is protecting against automated scraping, which is why we're getting 0 results. This is actually good - it means our scraping code is working, but DuckDuckGo is doing their job protecting against bots.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Solutions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Option 1: Use DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API (Free)**\n",
        "This is what we're already falling back to, but it has limited results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Option 2: Use a Different Search Engine**\n",
        "- **Bing Search API** (free tier available)\n",
        "- **Google Custom Search API** (paid)\n",
        "- **SearX** (open source metasearch)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Option 3: Use News APIs for Current Content**\n",
        "- **NewsAPI** (free tier)\n",
        "- **Guardian API** (free)\n",
        "- **Reddit API** (free)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Option 4: Accept Simulated Results for Now**\n",
        "Since this is a learning project, we could use simulated results that are more realistic.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **My Recommendation:**\n",
