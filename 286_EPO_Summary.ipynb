        "## 🎯 What This Agent Does\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Experimentation Portfolio Orchestrator** is an AI system that manages the full lifecycle of experiments across an organization. It transforms experimentation from a scattered, manual effort into a **disciplined, automated, organization-wide capability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Portfolio Analysis** - Analyzes all experiments in your portfolio, identifying what's working, what needs attention, and what's missing\n",
        "2. **Automated Analysis Calculation** - Calculates experiment metrics (lift, confidence, direction) from raw data when analysis is missing\n",
        "3. **Decision Generation** - Generates recommendations (scale, iterate, retire, do_not_start) based on configurable business rules\n",
        "4. **Portfolio Insights** - Identifies patterns, risks, and opportunities across experiments\n",
        "5. **Comprehensive Reporting** - Generates detailed markdown reports with experiment details, analysis, decisions, and insights\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Goal → Planning → Data Loading → Portfolio Analysis → Decision Generation → Report Generation\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💼 Why This Agent Is Valuable to Companies\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem Companies Face\n",
        "\n",
        "Nearly every company struggles with the same challenge: **They invest in AI, but cannot prove what works, why it works, or how to scale it.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Executives consistently ask:\n",
        "- \"Did this AI actually increase productivity?\"\n",
        "- \"Which workflows are worth automating?\"\n",
        "- \"Should we scale this model or shut it down?\"\n",
        "- \"Where is the ROI?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Solution This Agent Provides\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making** 🎯\n",
        "\n",
        "No more assumptions or hype-driven rollouts. This agent shows **causal impact** with metrics that matter:\n",
        "- Calculates lift percentages from experiment data\n",
        "- Assesses statistical confidence\n",
        "- Provides clear rationale for decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Instead of guessing if AI email drafting works, the agent shows: \"44.4% lift in reply rates with medium confidence → Scale decision.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Faster, Safer Scaling of AI** 🚀\n",
        "\n",
        "Companies often get stuck in \"pilot purgatory\" - running experiments forever without making decisions. This orchestrator:\n",
        "- Identifies experiments worth scaling (>20% lift)\n",
        "- Flags experiments that pose risk (<-10% lift)\n",
        "- Provides clear recommended actions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** E001 shows 44.4% improvement → Immediate \"Scale\" recommendation with action plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Unified View of All AI Initiatives** 📊\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of siloed projects across sales, HR, finance, and support, the orchestrator builds a **central portfolio** with:\n",
        "- Experiment metadata (status, domain, owner, dates)\n",
        "- KPIs and metrics\n",
        "- Analysis results\n",
        "- Risk assessments\n",
        "- Decisions and recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** One report shows all 3 experiments across sales, support, and HR with unified analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Reduced Waste and Avoided Failures** 💰\n",
        "\n",
        "Most failed AI projects fail because they lacked:\n",
        "- Clear hypotheses\n",
        "- Measurable outcomes\n",
        "- Proper experimentation discipline\n",
        "\n",
        "This agent **enforces rigor** by:\n",
        "- Requiring hypothesis and success criteria\n",
        "- Calculating metrics automatically\n",
        "- Generating decisions based on data, not opinions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** E003 flagged as \"Do Not Start\" because success criteria are unclear → Saves resources before launch.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Continuous Organizational Learning** 📈\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps companies evolve from occasional experiments to a culture of **ongoing, compounding learning**:\n",
        "- Tracks experiment status across lifecycle\n",
        "- Identifies patterns across domains\n",
        "- Generates insights for future experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Portfolio insights show \"High-performing experiments\" pattern → Guides future experiment design.\n",

        "- `utilities/portfolio_analysis.py` - Statistical calculations without LLM\n",

        "\n",
        "**What It Is:**\n",
        "- **Nodes** = Thin orchestration layer (workflow coordination)\n",
        "- **Utilities** = Reusable business logic (data operations, calculations)\n",
