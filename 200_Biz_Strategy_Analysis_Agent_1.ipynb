        "\n",
        "After reviewing multiple iterations of SWOT reports and analyzing the gap between persona expectations and actual output, this document proposes a redesigned architecture that would significantly improve output quality if we were to rebuild the agent from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Insight:** The current architecture is **post-hoc validation** (check quality after generation), but what we need is **guided generation** (enforce quality during generation).\n",

        "✅ Persona is helping but not fully enforced  \n",
        "✅ Structure is solid  \n",
        "✅ Source reliability scoring exists  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Current Weaknesses\n",
        "❌ **Source quality filtering happens too late** - Low-quality sources are already in the analysis context  \n",
        "❌ **Single-pass analysis** - One LLM call tries to do everything  \n",

        "\n",
        "### Key Architectural Changes\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Source Filtering Node** (After Research, Before Analysis)\n",
        "**Purpose:** Filter and prioritize sources BEFORE they enter the analysis context\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- Sorts sources by reliability score\n",
        "- Prioritizes high-quality sources (corporate, SEC, major news) in research context\n",
        "- Marks low-quality sources as \"supplementary only\"\n",
        "- Limits low-quality sources to max 20% of research context\n",
        "- Adds source quality metadata to each research result\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:**\n",
        "- LLM sees better sources first\n",
        "- Low-quality sources don't dominate the context\n",
        "- Reduces need for post-hoc source warnings\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Competitive Benchmarking Node** (After Research, Before Analysis)\n",
        "**Purpose:** Gather competitive context that's essential for strategic analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- Identifies top 3-5 competitors from research\n",
        "- Generates targeted queries for each competitor\n",
        "- Gathers: market share, revenue, growth rates, key metrics\n",
        "- Stores in `state[\"competitive_benchmarks\"]`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:**\n",
        "- Enables comparative insights (\"Target's SG&A is 2.3% higher than Walmart\")\n",
        "- Provides context for impact scoring\n",
        "- Makes insights more strategic and less generic\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Multi-Stage Analysis** (Replace Single Analyze Node)\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of one `analyze_node`, split into:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3a. **Generate Insights Node**\n",
        "- Generates initial insights from research\n",
        "- Focuses on breadth and coverage\n",
        "- Less strict on depth (first pass)\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3b. **Validate Depth Node** (NEW)\n",
        "- Checks each insight for:\n",
        "  - Specificity (not generic)\n",
        "  - Causality (explains why, not just what)\n",
        "  - Quantification (has numbers/percentages)\n",
        "  - Competitive comparison (if applicable)\n",
        "- Flags insights that need deepening\n",
        "- Returns list of insights requiring refinement\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3c. **Deepen Insights Node** (NEW)\n",
        "- Takes flagged insights\n",
        "- Re-analyzes with focus on:\n",
        "  - Adding competitive benchmarks\n",
        "  - Quantifying implications\n",
        "  - Explaining causality\n",
        "  - Adding strategic context\n",
        "- Replaces generic insights with specific ones\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3d. **Add Strategic Implications Node** (NEW)\n",
        "- For each insight, explicitly adds:\n",
        "  - Why it matters strategically\n",
        "  - How it affects competitive position\n",
        "  - Financial/operational impact\n",
        "  - Risk or opportunity magnitude\n",
        "- Makes implications mandatory, not optional\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3e. **Add Benchmarks Node** (NEW)\n",
        "- For each insight, adds competitive comparison:\n",
        "  - \"Target's X is Y% vs. Walmart's Z%\"\n",
        "  - \"Market leader has A, Target has B\"\n",
        "  - \"Industry average is C, Target is D\"\n",
        "- Uses competitive_benchmarks from earlier node\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Quantify Impact Node** (NEW)\n",
        "**Purpose:** Replace qualitative \"High/Medium/Low\" with quantitative scoring\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "- Uses scoring rubric (0-5 scale) for each dimension:\n",
        "  - **Margin Impact** (0-5): How much does this affect profitability?\n",
        "  - **Growth Potential** (0-5): How much does this affect growth?\n",
        "  - **Competitive Durability** (0-5): How defensible is this advantage/weakness?\n",
        "  - **Risk Magnitude** (0-5): How significant is the threat/opportunity?\n",
        "- Calculates weighted score\n",
        "- Maps to High (4-5), Medium (2-3), Low (0-1)\n",
        "- Stores both quantitative score and qualitative label\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:**\n",
        "- Impact ratings are now justified and comparable\n",
        "- Can prioritize insights by score\n",
        "- More consultant-grade rigor\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Enhanced Confidence Scoring**\n",
        "**Current:** `confidence = f(source_reliability, base_confidence)`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proposed:** `confidence = f(source_reliability, source_alignment, evidence_strength, recency, industry_knowledge)`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Components:**\n",
        "- Source reliability (existing)\n",
        "- Source alignment: Do multiple sources agree?\n",
        "- Evidence strength: Quantitative vs. qualitative\n",
        "- Recency: How recent is the data?\n",
        "- Industry knowledge: Is this a well-known fact?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:**\n",
        "- Brand equity shouldn't be 55% just because source is weak\n",
        "- Well-supported insights get appropriate confidence\n",
        "- More nuanced and accurate scoring\n",

        "   - Add competitive benchmarks early\n",
        "   - Filter sources before analysis\n",

        "1. **Performance vs. Quality Trade-off:**\n",
        "   - Multi-stage analysis = more LLM calls = higher cost\n",
        "   - Is the quality improvement worth 2-3x cost?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Incremental vs. Rebuild:**\n",
        "   - Can we achieve 80% of benefits with 20% of effort?\n",
        "   - Or do we need to rebuild for consultant-grade output?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Framework-Specific Needs:**\n",
        "   - Do all frameworks need benchmarking? (SWOT yes, PESTEL maybe not)\n",
        "   - Should we make some nodes framework-conditional?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **User Experience:**\n",

        "   - Should we add progress indicators?\n",

        "- **SWOT & Porter's:** Better competitive benchmarking, optimized personas\n",
        "- **PESTEL:** Specialized macro research, trend analysis\n",
        "- **Ansoff:** Market-focused research, risk assessment\n",

        "### Development Benefits\n",
        "- **Easier debugging:** Framework-specific issues isolated\n",
        "- **Faster iteration:** Optimize one framework without affecting others\n",
        "- **Clearer code:** No conditional logic, framework-specific nodes\n",

        "- **Shared utilities:** ~30% of code (source filtering, benchmarking, quality assessment)\n",
        "- **Agent-specific:** ~70% of code (orchestration, framework-specific nodes)\n",

        "### Why This Approach:\n",
        "1. **Optimal balance** - Specialization without excessive duplication\n",
        "2. **Better results** - Each agent optimized for its frameworks\n",
        "3. **Maintainable** - Shared utilities, clear separation\n",
        "4. **Scalable** - Easy to add new frameworks\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Priority:\n",
        "1. **Phase 1:** Extract shared utilities (enables everything else)\n",
        "2. **Phase 2:** Competitive Analysis Agent (SWOT + Porter's) - highest usage\n",

        "4. **Phase 4:** Growth Strategy Agent (Ansoff) - different focus\n",

        "### Risk Mitigation:\n",
        "- Keep old agent until new agents are proven\n",

        "- Document framework-specific requirements\n",

        "1. **Keep single agent** but add framework-specific nodes\n",
        "2. **Use conditional routing** to framework-specific sub-workflows\n",
        "3. **Gradually extract** shared utilities\n",

        "**Recommended: Split into 3 specialized agents**\n",
