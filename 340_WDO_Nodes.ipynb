        "\n",
        "This section defines how the Workforce Development Orchestrator **decides what it is trying to accomplish** and **how it will execute that work**. Rather than relying on implicit model reasoning, these nodes establish a transparent, rule-driven control layer that governs the entire agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "At a high level:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **goal node** defines *why* the agent is running\n",
        "* The **planning node** defines *how* the agent will proceed\n",

        "\n",
        "The `goal_node` translates user input into a structured, machine-readable objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of allowing free-form interpretation, the agent operates within one of two clearly defined scopes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Organization-wide analysis**\n",
        "* **Single-employee analysis**\n",
        "\n",

        "* Explicit\n",
        "* Inspectable\n",
        "* Stable across executions\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",

        "Goals are not hidden inside prompts or inferred implicitly. They are stored in state and carried through the entire workflow, which allows:\n",

        "* The outputs it is responsible for producing\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 📐 Fixed, Predictable Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "Every run follows the same logical structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load data\n",
        "2. Analyze risk\n",
        "3. Detect skill gaps\n",

        "5. Assess role evolution\n",
        "6. Prioritize outcomes\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 🔗 Explicit Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "Each step declares what it depends on. This ensures:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Correct sequencing\n",
        "* No hidden coupling between nodes\n",
        "* Clear failure boundaries\n",
        "\n",
        "If a dependency fails, the system can stop or degrade gracefully without producing misleading results.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 📦 Declared Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "Each step lists the state fields it produces. This turns the plan into a **data contract**, making it obvious:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Where each piece of intelligence comes from\n",
        "* Which node owns which responsibility\n",

        "* Route execution\n",
        "* Update state\n",

        "\n",
        "* Keeps orchestration readable\n",
        "* Makes logic reusable across agents\n",

        "## 4. Error Handling as a First-Class Concern\n",
        "\n",
        "Both nodes preserve and extend the shared `errors` list rather than overwriting it. This allows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multiple failures to be captured in a single run\n",
        "* Partial execution without silent data corruption\n",
        "* Clear post-run diagnostics\n",
