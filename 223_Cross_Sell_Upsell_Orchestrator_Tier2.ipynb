        "\n",
        "### **Opportunity Detection Rules:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Routine Gap Detection:**\n",
        "   - Essential categories: `cleanser`, `moisturizer`, `spf`\n",
        "   - If missing → routine_gap opportunity\n",
        "   - Priority: High (essential for basic routine)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Routine Step Detection:**\n",
        "   - Customer should have products in steps 1-5\n",
        "   - Missing steps → cross-sell opportunity\n",
        "   - Adjacent steps preferred (step 1 → step 2, step 2 → step 3, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ingredient Matching:**\n",
        "   - Match customer `skin_concerns` to product `target_concerns`\n",
        "   - Exact match = high fit\n",
        "   - Partial match = medium fit\n",
        "   - No match = low fit (but still possible if routine gap)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Upgrade Detection:**\n",
        "   - Check if customer has Tier 1 products\n",
        "   - If product has `upgrades_from` matching customer's Tier 1 products → upgrade opportunity\n",
        "   - Only for customers with `tier_preference` >= 2\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Replenishment Detection:**\n",
        "   - Calculate days since purchase\n",
        "   - If days >= `replenishment_cycle_days` → replenishment opportunity\n",
        "   - If days >= `replenishment_cycle_days - 7` → approaching replenishment\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Rule Priority (Order Matters):**\n",
        "1. Replenishment (highest priority - customer needs to repurchase)\n",
        "2. Routine gaps (essential categories missing)\n",
        "3. Routine step gaps (missing steps in routine)\n",
        "4. Ingredient matches (concern-based recommendations)\n",
        "5. Upgrades (Tier 1 → Tier 2)\n",

        "   - Test `load_customer_data(\"C001\")` → verify structure\n",
        "   - Test `load_product_catalog()` → verify 20 products loaded\n",

        "   - Test with customer C002 (missing moisturizer, SPF)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Opportunity Detection Utilities:**\n",
        "   - Test `find_cross_sell_opportunities()` → verify routine_step adjacency\n",
        "   - Test `find_ingredient_based_opportunities()` → verify concern matching\n",
        "   - Test `find_upgrade_opportunities()` → verify upgrade detection\n",
