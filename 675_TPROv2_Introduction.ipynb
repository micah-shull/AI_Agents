        "## Executive-Grade Vendor Risk Governance for AI-Driven Enterprises\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Third-Party Risk Orchestrator v2** is an enterprise-focused AI system designed to continuously evaluate, prioritize, and govern vendor risk across an organization’s ecosystem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike typical third-party risk tools that rely on static questionnaires, periodic reviews, or opaque AI scoring models, v2 is built around a different philosophy:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Risk management should be continuous, policy-driven, financially grounded, and executive-ready.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Version 2 evolves the original MVP into a **full lifecycle governance engine** — one that connects operational signals, control posture, contractual obligations, financial exposure, and human executive decisions into a single orchestrated system.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What’s New in Version 2\n",
        "\n",
        "Version 2 introduces five new data layers that fundamentally expand system behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Contract & Obligation Modeling** — renewal windows, DPAs, audit rights, SLA tiers, and certification requirements now directly influence risk posture and escalation paths.\n",
        "* **Internal Risk Event Streams** — audit failures, SLA breaches, onboarding delays, mitigation completions, and data-scope changes trigger real-time reassessment.\n",
        "* **Financial Exposure Modeling** — vendors are prioritized by revenue dependency, regulatory exposure, switching cost, and operational criticality — not just abstract risk scores.\n",
        "* **Control Maturity Trending** — historical control strength allows the system to surface early-warning signals and quantify remediation effectiveness.\n",
        "* **Executive Trigger Policies** — board-level escalation rules are externalized from code, creating explainable, auditable, governance-first AI behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these additions transform the orchestrator from a monitoring engine into a **decision-support system for executives and boards.**\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Design Philosophy\n",
        "\n",
        "The v2 architecture follows several core principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧭 Governance First\n",
        "\n",
        "Policies, escalation thresholds, and board-level triggers are represented explicitly as data — not hidden inside model prompts or application logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Explainable by Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Every alert, score, and escalation can be traced back to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* control evidence\n",
        "* risk events\n",
        "* contract clauses\n",
        "* financial exposure\n",
        "* historical trends\n",
        "* human decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧠 Orchestration Over Automation\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs enhance reporting and narrative — but **never replace deterministic risk logic.**\n",
        "Scoring, thresholds, and escalation remain rule-based and auditable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💰 Financially Grounded\n",
        "\n",
        "Risk is translated into dollars: revenue at risk, regulatory exposure, switching costs, and mitigation ROI.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 👥 Human-in-the-Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "High-impact decisions are automatically routed to executives and compliance leaders, with overrides and rationale captured for audit readiness.\n",

        "## Why This System Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Most AI agents focus on automating tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Third-Party Risk Orchestrator v2 focuses on **governing the enterprise.**\n",
        "\n",
        "It answers questions executives actually ask:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Which vendors pose the greatest financial exposure today?*\n",
        "* *Which renewals should be blocked until risk is reduced?*\n",
        "* *What issues require board attention this quarter?*\n",
        "* *Where is control posture degrading before incidents occur?*\n",
        "* *Which mitigations produced measurable risk reduction?*\n",
        "* *How much regulatory exposure did this system help avoid?*\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Portfolio Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is intentionally designed as a **governance-grade AI architecture showcase**:\n",

        "* event-driven orchestration\n",
        "* policy-driven escalation\n",

        "* audit-ready controls\n",
